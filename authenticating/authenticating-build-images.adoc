You might need to define authentication when building images. For example, authentication is needed when you push images to a private registry or pull source code from a Git repository. At the time of authentication, you can use your user name and password or secrets, which store the required sensitive data.

For authentication during an image build, you can configure basic or SSH authentication along with secrets in your `Build` custom resource (CR).
