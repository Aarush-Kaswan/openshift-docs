= Improving {pipelines-shortname} performance

If you experience slowness or recurrent failures of pipeline runs, you can take any of the following steps to improve the performance of {pipelines-shortname}.

* Monitor the resource usage of the nodes in the {OCP} cluster on which {pipelines-shortname} runs. If the resource usage is high, increase the number of nodes.
+
* Enable high-availability mode. This mode affects the controller that creates and starts pods for task runs and pipeline runs. In Red Hat testing, high-availability mode significantly reduced pipeline execution times as well as the delay from creating a `TaskRun` resource CR to the start of the pod executing the task run. To enable high-availability mode, make the following changes in the `TektonConfig` custom resource (CR):
** Set the `pipeline.performance.disable-ha` spec to `false`.
** Set the `pipeline.performance.buckets` spec to a number between `5` and `10`.
** Set the `pipeline.performance.replicas` spec to a number higher than `2` and lower than or equal to the `pipeline.performance.buckets` setting.

[NOTE]
====
You can try different numbers for buckets and replicas to observe the effect on performance. In general, higher numbers are beneficial. Monitor for exhausting the resources of the nodes, including CPU and memory utilization.
