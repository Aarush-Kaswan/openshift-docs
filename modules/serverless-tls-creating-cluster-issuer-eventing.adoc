= Creating a ClusterIssuer resource for Eventing

`ClusterIssuers` are Kubernetes resources that represent certificate authorities (CAs) that can generate signed certificates by honoring certificate signing requests.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.
* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName}.
* You have installed the {cert-manager-operator}.
* You have installed the OpenShift (`oc`) CLI.

.Procedure

. Create the `knative-eventing-ca-issuer` `ClusterIssuer` resource as follows:
+
Every Eventing component uses this issuer to issue their server's certs.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: knative-eventing-ca-issuer
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: knative-eventing-ca <1>
----
<1> The `secretName` value in the `cert-manager` namespace (default for {cert-manager-operator}) contains the certificate that can be used by Knative Eventing components.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `ClusterIssuer` name must be `knative-eventing-ca-issuer`.
====

. Apply the `ClusterIssuer` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
