= Querying metrics for all projects as a cluster administrator

As a cluster administrator or as a user with view permissions for all projects, you can access metrics for all default {product-title} and user-defined projects in the Metrics UI.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role or with view permissions for all projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

. From the *Administrator* perspective of the {product-title} web console, go to *Observe* -> *Metrics*.

. To add one or more queries, perform any of the following actions:
+
|===
|Option |Description

|Create a custom query.
|Add your Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) query to the *Expression* field.

As you type a PromQL expression, autocomplete suggestions are displayed in a list. These suggestions include functions, metrics, labels, and time tokens.
You can use the keyboard arrows to select one of these suggested items and then press Enter to add the item to your expression. You can also move your mouse pointer over a suggested item to view a brief description of that item.

|Add multiple queries. |Click *Add query*.

|Duplicate an existing query. |Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the query and select *Duplicate query*.

|Delete a query. |Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the query and select *Delete query*.

|Disable a query from being run. |Click the Options menu {kebab} next to the query and select *Disable query*.
|===

. To run queries that you created, click *Run queries*.
The metrics from the queries are visualized on the plot.
If a query is invalid, the UI shows an error message.
+
[NOTE]
====
Queries that operate on large amounts of data might time out or overload the browser when drawing time series graphs. To avoid this, click *Hide graph* and calibrate your query by using the metrics table. After finding a feasible query, enable the plot to draw the graphs.
