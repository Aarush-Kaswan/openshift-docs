= Troubleshooting declarative configuration

[role="_abstract"]
You can use the error messages displayed in the *Declarative configuration* section of the *Platform Configuration* -> *System Health* page to help in troubleshooting. The `roxctl declarative-config` command also includes a `lint` option to validate the configuration file and help you detect errors.

The error messages displayed in the *Declarative configuration* section of the *Platform Configuration* -> *System Health* page provide information about issues with declarative configurations. Problems with declarative configurations can be caused by the following conditions:

* The format of the configuration file is not in valid YAML.
* The configuration file contains invalid values, such as invalid access within a permission set.
* Invalid storage constraints exist, such as resource names are not unique or the configuration contains invalid references to a resource.

To validate configuration files, check for errors in configuration files, and make sure that there are no invalid storage constraints when creating and updating configuration files, use the `roxctl declarative-config lint` command.

To troubleshoot a storage constraint during deletion, check if the resource has been marked as `Declarative Orphaned`. This indicates that the declarative configuration referenced by a resource was deleted (for example, if the declarative configuration for a permission set that was referenced by a role was deleted). To correct this error, edit the resource to point to a new permission set, or restore the declarative configuration that was deleted.
