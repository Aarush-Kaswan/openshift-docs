= Job service leader election process

The Job service operates as a singleton service, meaning only one active instance can schedule and execute jobs.

To prevent conflicts when the service is deployed in the cloud, where multiple instances might be running, the Job service supports a leader election process. Only the instance that is elected as the leader manages external communication to receive and schedule jobs.

Non-leader instances remain inactive in a standby state but continue attempting to become the leader through the election process. When a new instance starts, it does not immediately assume leadership. Instead, it enters the leader election process to determine if it can take over the leader role.

If the current leader becomes unresponsive or if it is shut down, another running instance takes over as the leader.

[NOTE]
====
This leader election mechanism uses the underlying persistence backend, which is currently supported only in the PostgreSQL implementation.
