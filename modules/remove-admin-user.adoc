= Removing the admin user after installation

After an authentication provider has been successfully created, it is strongly recommended to remove the `admin` user.

Removing the `admin` user is dependent on the installation method of the {product-title-short} portal.

.Procedure

Perform one of the following procedures:

* For Operator installations, set `central.adminPasswordGenerationDisabled` to `true` in your `Central` custom resource.

* For Helm installations:
. In your `Central` Helm configuration, set `central.adminPassword.generate` to `false`.
. Follow the steps to change the configuration. See "Changing configuration options after deployment" for more information.

* For `roxctl` installations:
. When generating the manifest, set `Disable password generation` to `false`.
. Follow the steps to install Central by using `roxctl` to apply the changes. See "Install Central using the roxctl CLI" for more information.
