= Remove the admin user

After an authentication provider has been successfully created, it is strongly recommended to remove the `admin` user.

Removing the `admin` user is dependent on the installation method of the {product-title-short} portal.
Perform one of the following procedures:

* For operator installations, set `central.adminPasswordGenerationDisabled` to `true` in your `Central` custom resource.

* For helm installations:
** In your `Central` helm configuration set `central.adminPassword.generate` to `false`.
** Follow the steps xref:./change-config-options-after-deployment-central-service.adoc[Change config options after deployment] to update the configuration.

* For roxctl installations:
** When generating the manifest, set `Disable password generation` to `false`.
** Follow the steps xref:./install-central-roxctl.adoc[Install Central roxctl] to apply the changes.
