= Distinguishing between syntactic and semantic difference outputs

In the following example, `dir1` is link:https://github.com/np-guard/netpol-analyzer/tree/main/tests/netpol-analysis-example-minimal[`netpol-analysis-example-minimal/`], and `dir2` is link:https://github.com/np-guard/netpol-analyzer/tree/main/tests/netpol-diff-example-minimal[`netpol-diff-example-minimal/`]. The difference between the directories is a small change in the network policy `backend-netpol`.

.Example policy from `dir1`:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: backend-netpol
spec:
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
    - port: 9090
      protocol: TCP
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backendservice
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
status: {}
----

The change in `dir2` is an added `-` before the ports attribute, which produces a difference output.
