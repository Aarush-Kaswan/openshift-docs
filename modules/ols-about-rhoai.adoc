= About {rhoai} 

{rhoai} is OpenAI API-compatible, and is configured largely the same as the OpenAI provider. 

You need a Large Language Model (LLM) deployed on the single model-serving platform of {rhoai} using the Virtual Large Language Model (vLLM) runtime. If the model deployment is in a different {ocp-short-name} environment than the {ols-long} deployment, the model deployment must include a route to expose it outside the cluster. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2-latest/html/serving_models/serving-large-models_serving-large-models#about-the-single-model-serving-platform_serving-large-models[About the single-model serving platform].
