= Measuring latency

The `cnf-tests` image uses the `oslat` tool to measure the latency of the system.

oslat:: Behaves similarly to a CPU-intensive DPDK application and measures all the interruptions and disruptions to the busy loop that simulates CPU heavy data processing.

The tests introduce the following environment variables:

|Environment variables
|Description

|`LATENCY_TEST_DELAY`
|Specifies the amount of time in seconds after which the test starts running. You can use the variable to allow the CPU manager reconcile loop to update the default CPU pool. The default value is 0.

|`LATENCY_TEST_CPUS`
|Specifies the number of CPUs that the pod running the latency tests uses. If you do not set the variable, the default configuration includes all isolated CPUs.

|`LATENCY_TEST_RUNTIME`
|Specifies the amount of time in seconds that the latency test must run. The default value is 300 seconds.

|`OSLAT_MAXIMUM_LATENCY`
|Specifies the maximum acceptable latency in microseconds for the `oslat` test results. If you do not set a value for `OSLAT_MAXIMUM_LATENCY`, the tool skips the comparison of the expected and the actual maximum latency.

|`LATENCY_TEST_RUN`
|Boolean parameter that indicates whether the tests should run. `LATENCY_TEST_RUN` is set to `false` by default. To run the latency tests, set this value to `true`.
