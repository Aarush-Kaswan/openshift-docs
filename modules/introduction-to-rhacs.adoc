{rh-rhacs-first} is an enterprise-ready, Kubernetes-native container security solution that helps you build, deploy, and run cloud-native applications more securely.

{rh-rhacscs-first} provides Kubernetes-native security as a service.
With {product-title-managed-short}, Red Hat maintains, upgrades, and manages your Central services.

Central services include the user interface (UI), data storage, {product-title-short} application programming interface (API), and image scanning capabilities.
You deploy your Central service through the link:https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.] When you create a new ACS instance, Red Hat creates your individual control plane for {product-title-short}.

{product-title-managed-short} allows you to secure self-managed clusters that communicate with a Central instance.
The clusters you secure, called Secured Clusters, are managed by you, and not by Red Hat.
Secured Cluster services include optional vulnerability scanning services, admission control services, and data collection services used for runtime monitoring and compliance.
You install Secured Cluster services on any OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster you want to secure.
