= About volume snapshots

You can create snapshots of persistent volume claims (PVCs) that are provisioned by {lvms}.

You can perform the following actions using the volume snapshots:

* Back up your application data.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Volume snapshots are located on the same devices as the original data. To use the volume snapshots as backups, you must move the snapshots to a secure location. You can use OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) backup and restore solutions. For information on OADP, see "OADP features".
====

* Revert to a state at which the volume snapshot was taken.

[NOTE]
====
You can also create volume snapshots of volume clones.
