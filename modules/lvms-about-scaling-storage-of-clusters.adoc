= Ways to scale up the storage of a {sno} cluster

You can scale up the storage of a {sno} cluster by adding new devices to the existing node. 

To add a new device to the existing node on a {sno} cluster, you must add the path to the new device in the `deviceSelector` field of the `LVMCluster` custom resource (CR).

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can add the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR only while creating the `LVMCluster` CR. If you have not added the `deviceSelector` field while creating the `LVMCluster` CR, you must delete the `LVMCluster` CR and create a new `LVMCluster` CR containing the `deviceSelector` field.
====

If you do not add the `deviceSelector` field in the `LVMCluster` CR, {lvms} automatically adds the new devices when the devices are available.
