= Advanced trigger filters overview

The advanced trigger filters feature adds a new `filters` field to triggers that aligns with the filters API field defined in the `CloudEvents Subscriptions` API. You can specify filter expressions, where each expression evaluates to `true` or `false` for each event. 

The following example shows a trigger using the advanced filters field:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: my-service-trigger
spec:
  broker: default
  filters:
    - cesql: "source LIKE '%commerce%' AND type IN ('order.created', 'order.updated', 'order.canceled')"
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: my-service
----

The `filters` field contains an array of filter expressions, each evaluating to either `true` or `false`. If any expression evaluates to `false`, the event is not sent to the subscriber. Each filter expression uses a specific dialect that determines the type of filter and the set of allowed additional properties within the expression.
