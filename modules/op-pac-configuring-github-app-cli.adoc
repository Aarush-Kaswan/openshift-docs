= Configuring a GitHub App using the command line interface

You can use the `tkn` command line utility to create a GitHub app and configure the {pac} controller for the GitHub app.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you created additional {pac} controllers to support additional GitHub apps, you can use this procedure only for the main controller. To create a GitHub app for an additional controller, use the manual procedure.
