= Usage in clusters with pod security standards

You can configure pod security related fields in the `buildkit` strategy. Based on your cluster setup and administrative configuration, you can use the following settings:

* Define the `unconfined` profile for both the `AppArmor` and `seccomp` parameters as required by the underlying `rootlesskit` package.
* Set the value of the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` flag to `true` to use binaries that have the `setuid` bit configured to run with root level privileges. Enabling the flag supports the `rootlesskit` package to set the user namespace mapping file `/proc/<pid>/uid_map`.
* Set the value of the `runAsUser` field to `UID 1000` or `GID 1000` to support executing tasks for non-root users.

The preceding settings have no effect when pod security standards are not used with your cluster.

[NOTE]
====
You cannot run the `rootlesskit` package to start the `buildkit` daemon without the `allowPrivilegeEscalation` flag set to `true`. Clusters with the restricted security standard in place cannot use the `buildkit` strategy.
