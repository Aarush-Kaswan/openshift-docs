== Bug fixes
Before this update, the LokiStack ruler pods would not format the IPv6 pod IP in HTTP URLs used for cross pod communication, causing querying rules and alerts through the Prometheus-compatible API to fail. With this update, the LokiStack ruler pods encapsulate the IPv6 pod IP in square brackets, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4892[LOG-4892])
