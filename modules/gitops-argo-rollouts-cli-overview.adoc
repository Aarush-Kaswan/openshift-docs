= Argo Rollouts CLI overview

You can use the Argo Rollouts CLI, which is an optional plugin, to manage and monitor Argo Rollouts resources directly, bypassing the need to use the {OCP} web console or the CLI (`oc`).

With the Argo Rollouts CLI plugin, you can perform the following actions:

* Make changes to an Argo Rollouts image.
* Monitor the progress of an Argo Rollouts promotion.
* Proceed with the promotion steps in a canary deployment.
* Terminate a failed Argo Rollouts deployment.

The Argo Rollouts CLI plugin directly integrates with `oc` and `kubectl` commands.
