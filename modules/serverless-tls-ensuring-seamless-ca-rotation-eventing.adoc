= Ensuring seamless CA rotation

Ensuring seamless CA rotation is essential to avoid service downtime or to handle emergencies.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.
* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName}.
* You have installed the {cert-manager-operator}.
* You have installed the OpenShift (`oc`) CLI.

.Procedure

. Create a CA certificate.
. Add the public key of the new CA certificate to the CA trust bundles. 
+
Ensure that you also keep the public key of the existing CA.
. Ensure all clients use the latest CA trust bundles.
+
Knative Eventing components automatically reload the updated CA trust bundles. For custom workloads that consume trust bundles, reload or restart them as needed.
. Update the `knative-eventing-ca-issuer` `ClusterIssuer` to reference the secret containing the CA certificate that you created in step 1.
. Force `cert-manager` to renew certificates in the `knative-eventing namespace`.
+
For more information about `cert-manager`, see link:https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/certificate/#reissuance-triggered-by-user-actions[Reissuance triggered by user actions].
. As soon as the CA rotation is fully completed, remove the public key of the old CA from the trust bundle config map.
