= Supporting services scope

The `SonataFlowPlatform` custom resource (CR) enables the deployment of supporting services within a specific namespace. This means all automatically configured supporting services and workflow communications are restricted to the namespace of the deployed platform.

This feature is particularly useful when separate instances of supporting services are required for different sets of workflows. For example, you can deploy an application in isolation with its workflows and supporting services, ensuring they remain independent from other deployments.
