= Multi-platform builds

The sample build strategy contains a `platforms` array parameter that you can set to use the `buildkit` strategy for building multi-platform images. If you do not set this array parameter, the image is built for the platform that is supported by the `FROM` image defined in your build strategy resource. If that image supports multiple platforms, then the image is built for the platform of your cluster node.
