= Understanding the administration event details

The administration event provide log information that describes the error or event. They provide important information for understanding a specific issue or incident and includes information about the context of the event as well as the steps to take to fix the error.

The administration event page organizes information in the following groups:

* *Resource type*: Classifies events based on the resource or component type involved. Resource types include `API Token`, `Cluster`, `Image`, `Node`, and `Notifier`.
* *Resource name*: Specifies the name of the resource or component to which the event refers. It identifies the specific instance within the domain where the event occurred.
* *Event type*: Specifies the source of the event. Currently, Central generates log events that correspond to administration events created from log statements.
* *Event ID*: A unique identifier assigned to each event. It serves as a reference point and can be useful in tracking and managing events over time. Event IDs are unique alphanumeric characters that help identify and distinguish events.
* *Created at*: Indicates the timestamp and date when the event was originally created or recorded. It provides an indication of when the event was first detected or created.
* *Last occurred at*: Specifies the timestamp and date when the event last occurred. This tracks the timing of the event, which can be critical for diagnosing and fixing recurring issues.
* *Count*: Indicates the number of times a particular event occurred. This number is useful in assessing the frequency of an issue. An event that has occurred multiple times indicates a persistent issue you need to fix.
