+
** NodeJS
** Python
** TypeScript
** Quarkus

[id="fixed-issues-1-30_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Previously, the `3scale-kourier-gateway` pod was sending thousands of `net-kourier-controller` DNS queries daily. New queries were being sent for each `NXDOMAIN` reply. This continued until the correct DNS query was produced.
+
The query now has the `net-kourier-controller.knative-serving-ingress.svc.<cluster domain>.` fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) by default, which solves the problem.

[id="known-issues-1-30-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Building and deploying a function using Podman version 4.6 fails with the `invalid pull policy "1"` error.
+
To work around this issue, use Podman version 4.5.

* On-cluster function building, including using Pipelines-as-code, is not supported on {ibmzProductName} and {ibmpowerProductName}.

* Buildpack builder is not supported on {ibmzProductName} and {ibmpowerProductName}.
