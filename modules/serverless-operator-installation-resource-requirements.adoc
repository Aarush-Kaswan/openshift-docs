= {ServerlessOperatorName} resource requirements

The following sample setup might help you to estimate the minimum resource requirements for your {ServerlessOperatorName} installation. Your specific requirements might be significantly different, and might grow as your use of {ServerlessProductName} increases.

The test suite used in the sample setup has the following parameters:

* An {ocp-product-title} cluster with:
** 10 workers (8 vCPU, 16GiB memory)
** 3 workers dedicated to Kafka
** 2 workers dedicated to Prometheus
** 5 workers remaining for both {ServerlessProductShortName} and test deployments

* 89 test scenarios running in parallel, mainly focused on using the control plane. Testing scenarios typically have a Knative Service sending events through an in-memory channel, a Kafka channel, an in-memory broker, or a Kafka broker to either a Deployment or a Knative Service.

* 48 re-creation scenarios, where the testing scenario is repeatedly being deleted and re-created.

* 41 stable scenarios, where events are sent throughout the test run slowly but continuously.

* The test setup contains, in total:
** 170 Knative Services
** 20 In-Memory Channels
** 24 Kafka Channels
** 52 Subscriptions
** 42 Brokers
** 68 Triggers
