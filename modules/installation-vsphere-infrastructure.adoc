[id="installation-vsphere-infrastructure_{context}"]
= VMware vSphere infrastructure requirements

You must install an {product-title} cluster on one of the following versions of a VMware vSphere instance that meets the requirements for the components that you use:

* Version 7.0 Update 2 or later
* Version 8.0 Update 1 or later

You can host the {vmw-full} infrastructure on-premise or on a link:https://cloud.vmware.com/providers[VMware Cloud Verified provider] that meets the requirements outlined in the following table:

.Version requirements for vSphere virtual environments
[cols=2, options="header"]
|===
|Virtual environment product |Required version
|VMware virtual hardware | 15 or later
|vSphere ESXi hosts | 7.0 Update 2 or later; 8.0 Update 1 or later
|vCenter host   | 7.0 Update 2 or later; 8.0 Update 1 or later
|===

.Minimum supported vSphere version for VMware components
|===
|Component | Minimum supported versions |Description

|Hypervisor
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 (or later) or vSphere 8.0 Update 1 (or later) with virtual hardware version 15
|This version is the minimum version that {op-system-first} supports. For more information about supported hardware on the latest version of {op-system-base-full} that is compatible with {op-system}, see link:https://catalog.redhat.com/hardware/search[Hardware] on the Red Hat Customer Portal.

|Storage with in-tree drivers
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 and later; 8.0 Update 1 or later
|This plugin creates vSphere storage by using the in-tree storage drivers for vSphere included in {product-title}.

ifndef::vmc[]
|Optional: Networking (NSX-T)
|vSphere 7.0 Update 2 or later; vSphere 8.0 Update 1 or later
|At a minimum, vSphere 7.0 Update 2 or vSphere 8.0 Update 1 is required for {product-title}. For more information about the compatibility of NSX and {product-title}, see the Release Notes section of VMware's link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-Container-Plugin/index.html[NSX container plugin documentation].
endif::vmc[]

|CPU micro-architecture
|x86-64-v2 or higher
|OpenShift 4.13 and later are based on RHEL 9.2 host operating system which raised the microarchitecture requirements to x86-64-v2. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/9.0_release_notes/index#architectures[RHEL Microarchitecture requirements documentation]. You can verify compatibility by following the procedures outlined in link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7052996[this KCS article].
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must ensure that the time on your ESXi hosts is synchronized before you install {product-title}. See link:https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.vcenterhost.doc/GUID-8756D419-A878-4AE0-9183-C6D5A91A8FB1.html[Edit Time Configuration for a Host] in the VMware documentation.
