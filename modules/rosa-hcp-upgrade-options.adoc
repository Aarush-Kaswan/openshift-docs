= Upgrade options for {hcp-title} clusters

In OpenShift, upgrading means provisioning a new component with updated software and using it to replace an existing component that has outdated software.

You can control the impact of upgrades to your workload by controlling which parts of the cluster are upgraded, for example:

Upgrade only the hosted control plane:: This does not impact your worker nodes.

Upgrade nodes in a single machine pool:: This initiates a rolling replacement of nodes in the specified machine pool, and temporarily impacts the worker nodes on that machine pool. This does not impact nodes on other machine pools in the cluster.

Upgrade nodes in multiple machine pools simultaneously:: This initiates a rolling replacement of nodes in the specified machine pools, and temporarily impacts the worker nodes on those machine pools. You can run this type of upgrade as a single command, or as multiple commands.

Upgrade the whole cluster in sequence:: This initiates upgrade of the hosted control plane, followed by a rolling replacement of nodes in the specified machine pools. These upgrades occur in sequence because the hosted control plane and the machine pools cannot be upgraded at the same time. When an upgrade of the hosted control plane is in progress, nodes in the machine pools cannot be upgraded. When upgrade is in progress for nodes in the machine pools, the hosted control plane cannot be upgraded.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To maintain compatibility between nodes in the cluster, nodes in machine pools cannot use a newer version than the hosted control plane. This means that the hosted control plane should always be upgraded to a given version before any machine pools are upgraded to the same version.
====

The time required to upgrade the hosted control plane varies depending on your workload configuration.

The time required to upgrade a machine pool varies according to the number of worker nodes in the machine pool (`--replicas` or `--max-replicas`).

You can further control the time required for an upgrade, and the impact of an upgrade to your workload, by editing the `--max-surge` and `--max-unavailable` values for each machine pool. These options control the number of nodes that can be upgraded simultaneously, and whether an upgrade provisions excess nodes or makes some existing nodes unavailable or both, for example:

* **To prioritize high workload availability**, you can provision excess nodes instead of making existing nodes unavailable by setting a higher value for `--max-surge` and setting `--max-unavailable` to `0`.
* **To prioritize lower infrastructure costs**, you can make some existing nodes unavailable and avoid provisioning excess nodes by setting a higher value for `--max-unavailable` and setting `--max-surge` to `0`.
* **To prioritize upgrade speed by upgrading multiple nodes simultaneously**, you can provision excess nodes and allow some existing nodes to be made unavailable by configuring moderate values for both `--max-surge` and `--max-unavailable`.

For more information about these parameters and their usage, see the _ROSA CLI reference_ for `rosa edit machinepool`.
