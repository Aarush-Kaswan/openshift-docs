= Source-to-image

This build strategy is composed of `source-to-image` and `buildah` strategies. You can use this strategy to generate a container file and prepare the application to build with a builder image.

The `source-to-image` strategy requires a specially crafted builder image, which you can pass as a parameter in the `spec.paramValues` field of the `Build` CR.
