== Fixed issues

Before this update, due to the incorrect filtering of URL protocols in the Argo CD application summary component, an attacker could use cross-site scripting with permission to edit the application. This update fixes the issue by upgrading the Argo CD version to 2.9.8, which patches this vulnerability. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-4210[GITOPS-4210]
