You can turn off the enforcement on relevant policies, which in turn instructs the admission controller to skip enforcements.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management*.
. Disable enforcement on the default policies:
** In the policies view, locate the *Kubernetes Actions: Exec into Pod* policy. Click the overflow menu, {kebab}, and then select *Disable policy*.
** In the policies view, locate the *Kubernetes Actions: Port Forward to Pod* policy. Click the overflow menu, {kebab}, and then select *Disable policy*.
. Disable enforcement on any other custom policies that you have created by using criteria from the default *Kubernetes Actions: Port Forward to Pod* and *Kubernetes Actions: Exec into Pod* policies.
