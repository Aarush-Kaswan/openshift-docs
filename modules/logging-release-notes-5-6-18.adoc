== Enhancements

* Before this update, {loki-op} set up Loki to use path-based style access for the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), which has been deprecated. With this update, the {loki-op} defaults to virtual-host style without users needing to change their configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5404[LOG-5404])

* Before this update, the {loki-op} did not validate the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) endpoint used in the storage secret. With this update, the validation process ensures the S3 endpoint is a valid S3 URL, and the `LokiStack` status updates to indicate any invalid URLs. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5396[LOG-5396])

== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the Elastisearch Operator `ServiceMonitor` in the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace used static token and certificate authority (CA) files for authentication, causing errors in the Prometheus Operator in the User Workload Monitoring specification on the `ServiceMonitor` configuration. With this update, the Elastisearch Operator `ServiceMonitor` in the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace now references a service account token secret by a `LocalReference` object. This approach allows the User Workload Monitoring specifications in the Prometheus Operator to handle the Elastisearch Operator `ServiceMonitor` successfully. This enables Prometheus to scrape the Elastisearch Operator metrics. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5244[LOG-5244])

* Before this update, the {loki-op} did not validate the Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) endpoint URL format used in the storage secret. With this update, the S3 endpoint URL goes through a validation step that reflects on the status of the `LokiStack`. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5400[LOG-5400])
