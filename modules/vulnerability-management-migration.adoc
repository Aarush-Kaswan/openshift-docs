= Migration of vulnerability reports when upgrading to RHACS version 4.3 and later

[role="_abstract"]
{rh-rhacs-first} version 4.3 includes an automatic migration of vulnerability report configurations that were created in previous versions of {product-title-short} in the *Vulnerability Management 1.0* -> *Reporting* page. You can access migrated report configurations by clicking *Vulnerability Management (2.0)* -> *Vulnerability Reporting*. The previous versions of the report configurations are no longer available in the {product-title-short} web portal or by using the API.
//We can probably remove this section at some point, like after 4.2 and earlier versions are EOL.

{product-title-short} performs the following actions during the migration:

* Report configurations are copied to create a new version of the report that you can access by clicking *Vulnerability Management (2.0)* -> *Vulnerability Reporting*.
* The original name for the report is used when migrating reports to the new location.
* Report configurations created in the *Vulnerability Management 2.0 (Tech preview)* -> *Reporting* page are not affected by upgrading to {product-title-short} version 4.3 or later. The menu item to access these report configurations was renamed *Vulnerability Management (2.0)* and the page was renamed *Vulnerability Reporting*.
* If a report configuration previously created by using the *Vulnerability Management 1.0* page is not migrated because the notifier attached to it no longer exists, then the details of that configuration are added to the logs generated by the Central pod. You can use details from the log to re-create the report configuration by clicking *Vulnerability Management (2.0)* -> *Vulnerability Reporting* and adding a new report.
* For each report configuration that was previously created by using the *Vulnerability Management 1.0* page, the most recent successful scheduled report job is migrated to the *All Report jobs* section of the report configuration. To view the report configuration, click *Vulnerability Management (2.0)* -> *Vulnerability Reporting*, and then click the report configuration.

If you need to roll back to {product-title-short} 4.2 from a later version, the following actions occur:

* The report configurations that became defunct with migration now become functional again and are available by clicking *Vulnerability Management 1.0* -> *Reporting*.
* The report configurations created by the migration remain functional and are available by clicking *Vulnerability Reporting 2.0 (Tech Preview)*. You can manually delete unwanted report configurations created in either the 1.0 or 2.0 reporting version.
* If a report configuration in the *Vulnerability Management 1.0* -> *Reporting* page is updated after rolling back to {product-title-short} 4.2 or earlier, those updates might not be applied to the migrated report configuration when the system is upgraded again. If this happens, the details of the report configuration are added to the logs generated by the Central pod. You can manually update the report configuration by clicking *Vulnerability Management (2.0)* -> *Vulnerability Reporting* and using the details from the log.
* Any new report configurations created in the *Vulnerability Management 1.0* -> *Reporting* page are migrated when you upgrade again to {product-title-short} version 4.3 or later.
