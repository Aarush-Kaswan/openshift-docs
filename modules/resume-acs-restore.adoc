= Resuming the restore operation

[role="_abstract"]
If your connection is interrupted during a restore operation or you need to go offline, you can resume the restore operation.

* If you do not have access to the machine running the resume operation, you can use the `roxctl central db restore status` command to check the status of an ongoing restore operation.
* If the connection is interrupted, the `roxctl` CLI automatically attempts to restore a task as soon as the connection is available again.
The automatic connection retries depend on the duration specified by the `timeout` option.
* Use the `--timeout` option to specify the time in seconds, minutes or hours after which the `roxctl` CLI stops trying to resume a restore operation.
If the option is not specified, the default timeout is 10 minutes.
* If a restore operation gets stuck or you want to cancel it, use the `roxctl central db restore cancel` command to cancel a running restore operation.
* If a restore operation is stuck, you have canceled it, or the time has expired, you can resume the previous restore by running the original command again.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* During interruptions, {product-title-short} caches an ongoing restore operation for 24 hours.
You can resume this operation by executing the original restore command again.
* The `--timeout` option only controls the client-side connection retries and has no effect on the server-side restore cache of 24 hours.
* You cannot resume restores across Central pod restarts.
* If a restore operation is interrupted, you must restart it within 24 hours and before restarting Central, otherwise {product-title-short} cancels the restore operation.
