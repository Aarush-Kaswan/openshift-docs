= Configuring the workflow base builder image

If your scenario requires strict policies for image usage, such as security or hardening constraints, replace the default image used by the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} to build the final workflow container image.

By default, the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} uses the image distributed in the official Red{nbsp}Hat Registry to build workflows. If your scenario requires strict policies for image use, such as security or hardening constraints, you can replace the default image.

To change this image, you edit the `SonataFlowPlatform` custom resource (CR) in the namespace where you deployed your workflows.

.Prerequisites

* You have an {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} installed on your cluster.
* You have access to an {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI `(oc)`.

.Procedure

. List the `SonataFlowPlatform` resources in your namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get sonataflowplatform -n <your_namespace> <1>
----
+
<1> Replace `<your_namespace>` with the name of your namespace.

. Patch the `SonataFlowPlatform` resource with the new builder image by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc patch sonataflowplatform <name> --patch 'spec:\n  build:\n    config:\n      baseImage: <your_new_image_full_name_with_tag>' -n <your_namespace>
----

.Verification

. Verify that the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR has been patched correctly by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe sonataflowplatform <name> -n <your_namespace> <1>
----
+
<1> Replace `<name>` with the name of your `SonataFlowPlatform` resource and `<your_namespace>` with the name of your namespace.
+
Ensure that the `baseImage` field under `spec.build.config` reflects the new image.
