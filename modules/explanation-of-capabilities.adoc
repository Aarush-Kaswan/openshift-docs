= Optional cluster capabilities in {product-title} {product-version}

Optional cluster capabilities are components that can be disabled during the installation process. Cluster administrators can disable optional cluster capabilities to reduce the resources consumed by a cluster. Currently, cluster Operators provide a cluster capability's features.

If you want to use the features provided by a disabled cluster capability, you can enable the capability after installation. After a cluster capability is enabled, it cannot be disabled.
