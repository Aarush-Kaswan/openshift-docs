= Editing the GOMEMLIMIT environment variable for the Admission Controller deployment

[role="_abstract"]
Upgrading to version 4.4 requires that you manually replace the `GOMEMLIMIT` environment variable with the `ROX_MEMLIMIT` environment variable. You must edit this variable for each deployment.

.Procedure

. Run the following command to edit the variable for the Admission Controller deployment:
+
[source,terminal,subs=attributes+]
----
$ oc -n stackrox edit deploy/admission-control <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.
. Replace the `GOMEMLIMIT` variable with `ROX_MEMLIMIT`.
. Save the file.
