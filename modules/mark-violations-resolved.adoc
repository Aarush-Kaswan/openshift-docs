. Click the overflow menu, {kebab}, and then select one of the following options:
* *Resolve and add to process baseline*: Resolves the violation and adds the associated process to the process baseline. If the process is executed again, a new violation will be displayed.
* *Mark as resolved*: Resolves the violation.
