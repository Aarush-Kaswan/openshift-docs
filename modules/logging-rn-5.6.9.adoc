== Bug fixes
* Before this update, when multiple roles were used to authenticate using STS with AWS Cloudwatch forwarding, a recent update caused the credentials to be non-unique. With this update, multiple combinations of STS roles and static credentials can once again be used to authenticate with AWS Cloudwatch. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4084[LOG-4084])

* Before this update, the Vector collector occasionally panicked with the following error message in its log: `thread 'vector-worker' panicked at 'all branches are disabled and there is no else branch', src/kubernetes/reflector.rs:26:9`. With this update, the error has been resolved. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4276[LOG-4276])

* Before this update, Loki filtered label values for active streams but did not remove duplicates, making Grafana's Label Browser unusable. With this update, Loki filters out duplicate label values for active streams, resolving the issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4390[LOG-4390])
