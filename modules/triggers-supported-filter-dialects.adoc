[id="triggers-supported-filter-dialects_{context}"]
= Supported filter dialects

You can use dialects to define flexible filter expressions to target specific events. 

The advanced trigger filters support the following dialects that offer different ways to match and filter events:

* `exact`
* `prefix`
* `suffix`
* `all`
* `any` 
* `not`
* `cesql` 

Each dialect provides a different method for filtering events based on a specific criteria, enabling precise event selection for processing.

[id="triggers-filter-exact-dialect_{context}"]
== `exact` filter dialect

The `exact` dialect filters events by comparing a string value of the CloudEvent attribute to exactly match the specified string. The comparison is case sensitive. If the attribute is not a string, the filter converts the attribute to its string representation before comparing it to the specified value.

.Example of the `exact` filter dialect

[id="triggers-filter-prefix-dialect_{context}"]
== `prefix` filter dialect

The `prefix` dialect filters events by comparing a string value of the CloudEvent attribute that starts with the specified string. This comparison is case sensitive. If the attribute is not a string, the filter converts the attribute to its string representation before matching it against the specified value.

[id="triggers-filter-suffix-dialect_{context}"]
== `suffix` filter dialect

The `suffix` dialect filters events by comparing a string value of the CloudEvent attribute that ends with the specified string. This comparison is case-sensitive. If the attribute is not a string, the filter converts the attribute to its string representation before matching it to the specified value.

[id="triggers-filter-all-dialect_{context}"]
== `all` filter dialect

The `all` filter dialect needs that all nested filter expressions evaluate to `true` to process the event. If any of the nested expressions return `false`, the event is not sent to the subscriber.

            subject: https://github.com/cloudevents/spec
----

[id="triggers-filter-any-dialect_{context}"]
== `any` filter dialect

The `any` filter dialect requires at least one of the nested filter expressions to evaluate to `true`. If none of the nested expressions return `true`, the event is not sent to the subscriber.

----

[id="triggers-filter-not-dialect_{context}"]
== `not` filter dialect

The `not` filter dialect requires that the nested filter expression evaluates to `false` for the event to be processed. If the nested expression evaluates to `true`, the event is not sent to the subscriber.

[id="triggers-filter-cesql-dialect_{context}"]
== `cesql` filter dialect 

CloudEvents SQL expressions (cesql) allow computing values and matching of CloudEvent attributes against complex expressions that lean on the syntax of Structured Query Language (SQL) `WHERE` clauses.

The `cesql` filter dialect uses CloudEvents SQL expressions to filter events. The provided CESQL expression must evaluate to `true` for the event to be processed.

.Example of the `cesql` filter dialect
[source,terminal]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  ...
spec:
  ...
  filters:
    - cesql: "source LIKE '%commerce%' AND type IN ('order.created', 'order.updated', 'order.canceled')"
