* The `kn func` CLI plugin now uses `func` 1.13.

* OpenShift Serverless on ARM64 is now available as Technology Preview.
* The `NamespacedKafka` annotation is now deprecated. Use the standard Kafka broker without data plane isolation instead.

* When enabling the automatic `EventType` auto-creation, you can now easily discover events available within the cluster. This functionality is available as a Developer Preview.

* You can now use the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator to autoscale Knative Eventing sources for Apache Kafka sources, defined by a `KafkaSource` object. This functionality is available as a Technology Preview feature, offering enhanced scalability and efficiency for Kafka-based event sources within Knative Eventing.

[id="known-issues-1-33-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Due to different mount point permissions, direct upload on a cluster build does not work on {ibmzProductName} (s390x) and {ibmpowerProductName} (ppc64le).

* Building and deploying a function using Podman version 4.6 fails with the `invalid pull policy "1"` error.
+
To work around this issue, use Podman version 4.5.
