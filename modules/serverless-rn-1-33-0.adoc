[id="new-features-1-33-0_{context}"]
== New features

* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 1.12.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Eventing 1.12.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Kourier 1.12.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative (`kn`) CLI 1.12.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative for Apache Kafka 1.12.
* The `kn func` CLI plugin now uses `func` 1.14.

* {ServerlessProductName} on ARM64 is now available as Technology Preview.
* The `NamespacedKafka` annotation is now deprecated. Use the standard Kafka broker without data plane isolation instead.

* When enabling the automatic `EventType` auto-creation, you can now easily discover events available within the cluster. This functionality is available as a Developer Preview.

* You can now explore the Knative Eventing monitoring dashboards directly within the *Observe* tab of the developer view in the OpenShift Developer Console.

* You can now use the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator to autoscale Knative Eventing sources for Apache Kafka sources, defined by a `KafkaSource` object. This functionality is available as a Technology Preview feature, offering enhanced scalability and efficiency for Kafka-based event sources within Knative Eventing.

* You can now customize the internal Kafka topic properties when creating a Knative Broker with Kafka implementation. This improves efficiency and simplifies management.

* The new trigger filters feature is now available as a Technology Preview. These filters are enabled by default and allows users to specify a set of filter expressions, where each expression evaluates to either true or false for each event.

[id="known-issues-1-33-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

* Due to different mount point permissions, direct upload on a cluster build does not work on {ibmzProductName} (s390x) and {ibmpowerProductName} (ppc64le).

* Building and deploying a function using Podman version 4.6 fails with the `invalid pull policy "1"` error.
+
To work around this issue, use Podman version 4.5.
