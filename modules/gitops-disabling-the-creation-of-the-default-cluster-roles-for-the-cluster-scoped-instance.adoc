= Disabling the creation of the default cluster roles for the cluster-scoped instance

To add or remove permissions to cluster-wide resources, as needed, you must disable the creation of the default cluster roles for the cluster-scoped instance by editing the YAML file of the Argo CD custom resource (CR).

.Procedure

. In the Argo CD CR, set the value of the `.spec.defaultClusterScopedRoleDisabled` field to `true`:

<2> The namespace where you want to run the cluster-scoped instance.
<3> The flag value that disables the creation of the default cluster roles for the cluster-scoped instance. If you want the Operator to recreate the default cluster roles and cluster role bindings for the cluster-scoped instance, set the field value to `false`.

. Verify that the {gitops-title} Operator has deleted the default cluster roles and cluster role bindings for the {gitops-shortname} control plane components by running the following commands:

The default cluster roles and cluster role bindings for the cluster-scoped instance are not created. As a cluster administrator, you can now create and customize permissions for cluster-scoped instances by creating new cluster roles and cluster role bindings for the {gitops-shortname} control plane components.
