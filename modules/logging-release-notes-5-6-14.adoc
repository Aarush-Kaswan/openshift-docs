== Bug fixes

* Before this update, during the process of creating index patterns, the default alias was missing from the initial index in each log output. As a result, Kibana users were unable to create index patterns by using {es-op}. This update adds the missing aliases to {es-op}, resolving the issue. Kibana users can now create index patterns that include the `{app,infra,audit}-000001` indexes. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4807[LOG-4807])

* Before this update, the {loki-op} did not mount a custom CA bundle to the ruler pods. As a result, during the process to evaluate alerting or recording rules, object storage access failed. With this update, the {loki-op} mounts the custom CA bundle to all ruler pods. The ruler pods can download logs from object storage to evaluate alerting or recording rules. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4838[LOG-4838])
