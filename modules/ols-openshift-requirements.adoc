{ols-long} requires {ocp-product-title} 4.15 or later running on x86 hardware. Any installation type or deployment architecture is supported so long as the cluster is 4.15+ and x86-based.

For the {ols-long} {ols-release} release, the cluster you use must be connected to the Internet and it must have telemetry enabled. Telemetry is enabled by default. If you are using a standard installation process for {ocp-short-name} confirm that it does not disable telemetry.
