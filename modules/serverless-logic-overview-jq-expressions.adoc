= JQ expressions

Each workflow instance is associated with a data model. A data model consists of a `JSON` object regardless of whether the workflow file contains `YAML` or `JSON`. The initial content of the JSON object depends on how the workflow is started. If the workflow is created using the `CloudEvent`, then the workflow content is taken from the `data` property. If the workflow is started through an `HTTP` `POST` request, then the workflow content is taken from the request body.

The JQ expressions are used to interact with the data model. The supported expression languages include JsonPath and JQ. The JQ expression language is the default language. You can change the expression language to JsonPath using the `expressionLang` property.
