= About data, telemetry, transcript, and feedback collection

{ols-long} is a virtual assistant that you interact with using natural language. Communicating with {ols-long} involves sending chat messages, which may include information about your cluster, your cluster resources, or other aspects of your environment. These messages are sent to {ols-long}, potentially with some content filtered or redacted, and then sent to the LLM provider that you have configured.

Do not enter any information into the {ols-long} user interface that you do not want sent to the LLM provider.

The transcript recording data uses the {red-hat} Insights system back-end and is subject to the same access restrictions and other security policies described in link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/insights/data-application-security[Red Hat Insights data and application security].
