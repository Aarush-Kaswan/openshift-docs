= About {rhelai} 

{rhelai} is OpenAI API-compatible, and is configured in a similar manner as the OpenAI provider. 

You can configure {rhelai} as the (Large Language Model) LLM provider. 

Because the {rhel} is in a different environment than the {ols-long} deployment, the model deployment must allow access using a secure connection. For more information, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux_ai/1.2/html-single/building_your_rhel_ai_environment/index#creating_secure_endpoint[Optional: Allowing access to a model from a secure endpoint].
