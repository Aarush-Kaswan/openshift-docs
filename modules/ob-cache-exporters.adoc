= Cache exporters

The `buildkit` strategy uses caching to optimize the build time. When you push an image to a registry, the  `buildkit` strategy appends cache information to the image that is built. You can disable caching by setting the value of the `cache` parameter to `disabled` in the `paramValues` specification of the `Build` CR.
