[id="data-protection_{context}"]
= Data protection

[role="_abstract"]
Red{nbsp}Hat provides data protection by using various methods, such as logging, access control, and encryption.

[id="data-storage-media-protection_{context}"]
== Data storage media protection

To protect our data and client data from risk of theft or destruction, Red{nbsp}Hat employs the following methods:

* access logging
* automated account termination procedures
* application of the principle of least privilege

Data is encrypted in transit and at rest using strong data encryption following NIST guidelines and Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) where possible and practical. This includes backup systems.

{product-title-managed-short} encrypts data at rest within the Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) database by using AWS-managed Key Management Services (KMS) keys. All data between the application and the database, together with data exchange between the systems, are encrypted in transit.

[id="data-retention-destruction_{context}"]
=== Data retention and destruction

Records, including those containing personal data, are retained as required by law. Records not required by law or a reasonable business need are securely removed. Secure data destruction requirements are included in operating procedures, using military grade tools. In addition, staff have access to secure document destruction facilities.

[id="encryption_{context}"]
=== Encryption

Red{nbsp}Hat uses link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk[AWS managed keys] which are rotated by AWS each year. For information on the use of keys, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.Keys.html[AWS KMS key management]. For more information about RDS, see link:https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/security[Amazon RDS Security].

[id="multi-tenancy_{context}"]
=== Multi-tenancy

{product-title-managed-short} isolates tenants by namespace on {ocp}. SELinux provides additional isolation. Each customer has a unique RDS instance.

[id="data-ownership_{context}"]
=== Data ownership

Customer data is stored in an encrypted RDS database not available on the public internet. Only Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) have access to it, and the access is audited.

Every {product-title-managed-short} system comes integrated with Red{nbsp}Hat external SSO. Authorization rules are set up to provide administrator access to the user created the Cloud Service and to users who are marked as organization administrators in Red{nbsp}Hat SSO. The admin login is disabled for {product-title-managed-short} by default and can only be temporarily enabled by SREs.

Red{nbsp}Hat collects information about the number of secured clusters connected to {product-title-managed-short} and the usage of features. Metadata generated by the application and stored in the RDS database is owned by the customer. Red{nbsp}Hat only accesses data for troubleshooting purposes and with customer permission. Red{nbsp}Hat access requires audited privilege escalation.

Upon contract termination, Red{nbsp}Hat can perform a secure disk wipe upon request. However, we are unable to physically destroy media (cloud providers such as AWS do not provide this option).

To secure data in case of a breach, you can perform the following actions:

* Disconnect all secured clusters from {product-title-managed-short} immediately using the cluster management page.
* Immediately disable access to the {product-title-managed-short} by using the Access Control page.
* Immediately delete your {product-title-short} instance, which also deletes the RDS instance.

Any AWS RDS (data store) specific access modifications would be implemented by the {product-title-managed-short} SRE engineers.
