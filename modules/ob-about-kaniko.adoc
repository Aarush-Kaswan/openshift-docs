= Kaniko

You can use the `kaniko` cluster build strategy to build a container image from a container file or context directory. You can also use the `kaniko-trivy` cluster build strategy to scan the container image with the Trivy security scanner. If the scanner finds a critical vulnerability in the image, the `BuildRun` resource exits with an error and does not push the vulnerable image into the container registry.

[NOTE]
====
Performing image scanning does not guarantee you to trust the container file that you are building. If you want to secure the code that you want to build, you must use the `buildpacks v3` or `source-to-image` build strategy.
