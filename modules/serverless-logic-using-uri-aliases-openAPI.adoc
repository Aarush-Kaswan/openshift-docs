= Using URI alias

As an alternative to the `kogito.sw.operationIdStrategy` property, you can assign an alias to a URI by using the `workflow-uri-definitions` custom extension. This alias simplifies the configuration process and can be used as a configuration key in REST client settings and function definitions.

The `workflow-uri-definitions` extension allows you to map a URI to an alias, which you can reference throughout the workflow and in your configuration files. This approach provides a centralized way to manage URIs and their configurations.

.Prerequisites

* You have access to a {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have access to the OpenAPI specification files.

.Procedure

. Add the `workflow-uri-definitions` extension to your workflow. Within this extension, create aliases for your URIs.

      "operation": "remoteCatalog#operation2"
    }
  ]
}
----

<1> Set the extension ID to `workflow-uri-definitions`.
<2> Set the alias definition by mapping the `remoteCatalog` alias to a URI, for example, `https://my.remote.host/apicatalog/apis/123/document` URI.
<3> Set the function operations by using the `remoteCatalog` alias with the operation identifiers, for example,  `operation1` and `operation2` operation identifiers.

. In the `application.properties` file, configure the REST client by using the alias defined in the workflow.

.Example property
[source,sh]
----
quarkus.rest-client.remoteCatalog.url=http://localhost:8282/
----
+
In the previous example, the configuration key is set to `quarkus.rest-client.remoteCatalog.url`, and the URL is set to `http://localhost:8282/`, which the REST clients use by referring to the `remoteCatalog` alias.

. In your workflow, use the alias when defining functions that operate on the URI.
