= Choice of a certificate issuer

Issuers refer to `cert-manager` issuers and cluster issuers. They represent certificate authorities (CAs) that can generate signed certificates by honoring certificate signing requests. For more information, see link:https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/issuer/[cert-manager documentation on issuers].

Depending on the encryption features that you use, {ServerlessProductName} requires your certificate issuer to be able to sign certain certificates. To identify your certificate issuer, refer to the link:https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/issuers/[list of cert-manager integrations], which contains examples for the following:

* A custom CA stored in a Kubernetes secret
* HTTP-01 challenges
* DNS-01 challenges
* Self-signed issuers

== Compatible certificate issuers

Not all issuer types work for each Knative Serving encryption feature.

* For cluster-local encryption, the issuer must be able to sign certificates for the following cluster-local domain types:
+
--
** `myapp.<namespace>`
** `myapp.<namespace>.svc`
** `myapp.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`
--
+
As the CA usually is not within the cluster, verification using the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol (DNS01/HTTP01) is not possible. You can use an issuer that allows creating these certificates, such as the `cert-manager` CA issuer.

* For system-internal encryption, the issuer must be able to sign certificates with the following Subject Alternative Names (SANs):
+
--
** `kn-routing`
** names of format `kn-user-<namespace>`, where `<namespace>` is a namespace where Knative Services are created
** `data-plane.knative.dev`
--
+
Knative requires these SANs to verify connections between the internal components. Because this is not possible using the ACME protocol (DNS01/HTTP01), you must configure an issuer that allows creating these certificates, for example, `cert-manager` CA issuer.
