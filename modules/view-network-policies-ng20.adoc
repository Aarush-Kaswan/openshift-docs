= Viewing network policies in the network graph (2.0 preview)

[role="_abstract"]
Network policies specify how groups of pods are allowed to communicate with each other and with other network endpoints.
Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` resources use labels to select pods and define rules that specify what traffic is allowed to or from the selected pods.
{product-title-short} discovers and displays network policy information for all your Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, deployments, and pods, in the network graph.

.Procedure
. In the {product-title-short} portal, navigate to *Network Graph (2.0 preview)* and select your cluster from the drop-down list.
. Click the *Namespace* list and use the search field to locate a namespace or select individual namespaces.
. Click the *Deployments* list and use the search field to locate a deployment or select individual deployments to display in the network graph.
. In the network graph, click on a deployment to view the information panel.
. In the *Details* tab, in the *Network security* section, you can view summary messages about network policy rules that give the following information:
* If policies exist in the network that regulate ingress or egress traffic
* If your network is missing policies and therefore allowing all ingress or egress traffic
. To view the YAML file for the network policies, you can click on the policy rule, or click the *Network policies* tab.
