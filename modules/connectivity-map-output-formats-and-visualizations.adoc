= Connectivity map output formats and visualizations

You can use various output formats, including `txt`, `md`, `csv`, `json`, and `dot`. The `dot` format is ideal for visualizing the output as a connectivity graph. It can be viewed using graph visualization software such as link:https://graphviz.org/[Graphviz tool], and link:https://www.google.com/search?q=vscode+Graphviz+extension[extensions to VSCode]. You can convert the `dot` output to formats such as `svg`, `jpeg`, or `png` using Graphviz, whether it is installed locally or through an online viewer.
