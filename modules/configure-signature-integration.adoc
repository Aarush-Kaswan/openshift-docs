= Configuring signature integration

Before performing image signature verification, you must first create a signature integration in {product-title-short}.

A signature integration can be configured with multiple verification methods. The following verification methods are supported:

* Cosign public keys
* Cosign certificates

[id="configuring-cosign-public-keys_{context}"]
== Configuring Cosign public keys

.Prerequisites

* You must already have a PEM-encoded Cosign public key. For more information about Cosign, see link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview[Cosign overview].

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, select *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Scroll to *Signature Integrations* and click *Signature*.
. Click *New integration*.
. Enter a name for the *Integration name*.
. Click *Cosign public Keys* -> *Add a new public key*.
. Enter the *Public key* name.
. For the *Public key value* field, enter the PEM-encoded public key.
. (Optional) You can add more than one key by clicking *Add a new public key* and entering the details.

[id="configuring-cosign-certs_{context}"]
== Configuring Cosign certificates

.Prerequisites

* You must already have the certificate identity and issuer. Optionally, you also need a PEM-encoded certificate and chain. For more information about Cosign certificates, see link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/verifying/verify/#verify-image-with-user-provided-trusted-chain[Cosign certificate verification]

.Procedure

. In the {product-title-short} portal, select *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Scroll to *Signature Integrations* and click *Signature*.
. Click *New integration*.
. Enter a name for the *Integration name*.
. Click *Cosign certificates* -> *Add a new certificate verification*.
. Enter the *Certificate OIDC Issuer*. You can optionally use regular expressions in link:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[RE2 Syntax].
. Enter the *Certificate identity*. You can optionally use regular expressions in link:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[RE2 Syntax].
. (Optional) Enter the *Certificate Chain PEM encoded* to verify certificates. If no chain is provided, certificates are verified against the link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/certificate_authority/overview/[Fulcio] root.
. (Optional) Enter the *Certificate PEM encoded* to verify the signature.
. (Optional) You can add more than one certificate verification by clicking *Add a new certificate verification* and entering the details.
. Click *Save*.
