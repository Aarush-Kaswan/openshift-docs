{ServerlessProductName} 1.31 is now available. New features, updates, and known issues that pertain to {ServerlessProductName} on {ocp-product-title} are included in the following notes.

[id="new-features-1-31-0_{context}"]
== New features

* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 1.10.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Eventing 1.10.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Kourier 1.10.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative (`kn`) CLI 1.10.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative for Apache Kafka 1.10.
* The `kn func` CLI plug-in now uses `func` 1.11.

* {ServerlessProductName} multi-tenancy with {SMProductShortName} is now available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature.

* {FunctionsProductName} now supports the Go runtime as a Technology Preview (TP) feature.

* Serverless Logic, which is available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature, has been updated.
+
See link:https://openshift-knative.github.io/docs/docs/latest/serverless-logic/about.html[the Serverless Logic documentation] for usage instructions.

* You can now configure a persistent volume claim (PVC) for an existing `PersistentVolume` object to use with a Serverless function.

* When specifying Kourier for Ingress and using `DomainMapping`, the TLS for OpenShift Route is set to passthrough, and TLS is handled by the Kourier Gateway. Beginning with {ServerlessProductShortName} 1.31, it is possible to specify the enabled cipher suites on the side of the Kourier Gateway.

* Integrating {SMProductName} with {ServerlessProductShortName} when Kourier is enabled is now deprecated. Use `net-istio` instead of `net-kourier` for Service Mesh integration.
+
See the "Integrating {SMProductName} with {ServerlessProductShortName}" section for details.

* The `PodDistruptionBudget` and `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` objects have been added for the `3scale-kourier-gateway` deployment.
** `PodDistruptionBudget` is used to define the minimum availability requirements for pods in a deployment.
** `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` is used to automatically scale the number of pods in the deployment based on demand or on your custom metrics.

* Now you can change the pattern for Apache Kafka topic names used by Knative brokers and channels for Apache Kafka.

* The `DomainMapping` `v1alpha1` custom resource definition (CRD) is now deprecated. Use `v1beta1` CRD instead.

* The `NamespacedKafka` annotation, which was a Technology Preview (TP) feature, is now deprecated in favor of the standard Kafka broker with no data plane isolation.

[id="fixed-issues-1-31-0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

* Previously, when deploying Knative Eventing with full {SMProductName} integration and with `STRICT` peer authentication, the `PingSource` adapter metrics were unavailable.
+
This has been fixed, and the `PingSource` adapter metrics are now collected using a different `job` and `service` label value. The previous value was `pingsource-mt-adapter`, the new value is `pingsource-mt-adapter-sm-service`.
