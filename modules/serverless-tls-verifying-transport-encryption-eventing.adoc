= Verifying transport encryption in Eventing

To confirm that transport encryption is correctly configured, you can create and test an `InMemoryChannel` resource. Follow the steps to ensure that it uses HTTPS as expected.

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.
* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName}.
* You have installed the {cert-manager-operator}.
* You have installed the OpenShift (`oc`) CLI.

. Create an `InMemoryChannel` resource as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
kind: InMemoryChannel
metadata:
  name: transport-encryption-test
----

. Apply the `InMemoryChannel` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
----

. View the `InMemoryChannel` address by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get inmemorychannels.messaging.knative.dev transport-encryption-test
----
