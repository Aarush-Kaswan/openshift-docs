= Configuring the {product-title-managed-short} email plugin

The {product-title-managed-short} notifier sends an email to a recipient. You can  specify the recipient in the integration, or {product-title-managed-short} can use annotation keys to find the recipient.

[IMPORTANT]
====
* You can only send 250 emails per 24-hour rolling period. If you exceed this limit, {product-title-managed-short} sends emails only after the 24-hour period ends.
* Because of rate limits, Red{nbsp}Hat recommends using email notifications only for critical alerts or vulnerability reports.
====

.Procedure

. Go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Integrations*.
. Under the *Notifier Integrations* section, select *{product-title-managed-short} Email*.
. Select *New Integration*.
. In the *Integration name* field, enter a name for your email integration.
. Specify the email address to which you want to send the email notifications in the *Default recipient* field.
. Optional: Enter an annotation key in *Annotation key for recipient*. You can use annotations to dynamically determine an email recipient. To do this:

.. Add an annotation similar to the following example in your namespace or deployment YAML file, where `email` is the `Annotation key` that you specify in your email integration. You can create an annotation for the deployment or the namespace.

annotations:
  email: _<email_address>_
----
.. Use the annotation key `email` in the *Annotation key for recipient* field.

If you configured the deployment or namespace with an annotation, the {product-title-managed-short} sends the alert to the email specified in the annotation. Otherwise, it sends the alert to the default recipient.

[NOTE]
====

The following rules govern how {product-title-managed-short} determines the recipient of an email notification:

* If the deployment has an annotation key, the annotation's value overrides the default value.
* If the namespace has an annotation key, the namespace's value overrides the default value.
* If a deployment has an annotation key and a defined audience, {product-title-managed-short} sends an email to the audience specified in the key.
* If a deployment does not have an annotation key, {product-title-managed-short} checks the namespace for an annotation key and sends an email to the specified audience.
* If no annotation keys exist, {product-title-managed-short} sends an email to the default recipient.
