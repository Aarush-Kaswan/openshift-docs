= Connectivity mapping using the roxctl netpol connectivity map command

:FeatureName: Build-time network policy connectivity mapping
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

Connectivity mapping provides details on the allowed connections between different workloads based on network policies defined in Kubernetes manifests.
You can visualize and understand how different workloads in your Kubernetes environment are allowed to communicate with each other according to the network policies you set up.

To retrieve connectivity mapping information, the `roxctl netpol connectivity map` command requires a directory path that contains Kubernetes workloads and network policy manifests. The output provides details about connectivity details within the Kubernetes resources analyzed.
