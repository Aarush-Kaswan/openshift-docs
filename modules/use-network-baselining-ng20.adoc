= About network baselining in the network graph (2.0 preview)

[role="_abstract"]
In {product-title-short}, you can minimize your risks by using network baselining.
It is a proactive approach to keep your infrastructure secure.
{product-title-short} first discovers existing network flows and creates a baseline, and then it treats network flows outside of this baseline as anomalous.

When you install {product-title-short}, there is no default network baseline.
As {product-title-short} discovers network flows, it creates a baseline and then it adds all discovered network flows to it, following these guidelines:

* When {product-title-short} discovers new network activity, it adds that network flow to the network baseline.
* Network flows do not show up as anomalous flows and do not trigger any violations.

After the discovery phase, the following actions occur:

* {product-title-short} stops adding network flows to the network baselines.
* New network flows that are not in the network baseline show up as anomalous flows but they do not trigger any violations.
