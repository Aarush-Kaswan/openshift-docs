= Creating a log forwarder

To create a log forwarder, you must create a `ClusterLogForwarder` CR that specifies the log input types that the service account can collect. You can also specify which outputs the logs can be forwarded to. The `ClusterLogForwarder` CR must be named `instance`, and must be created in the `openshift-logging` namespace.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need administrator permissions for the `openshift-logging` namespace.
