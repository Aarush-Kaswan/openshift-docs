= Checking Ingress status

You might need to check the status of your Ingress to identify the issue with your Serverless application.

.Procedure

* Check the IP address of your Ingress by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway
----
+
The `istio-ingressgateway` service is the `LoadBalancer` service used by Knative.
+
If there is no external IP address, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system
----
+
This command prints the reason why IP addresses were not provisioned. Most likely, it is due to a quota issue.
