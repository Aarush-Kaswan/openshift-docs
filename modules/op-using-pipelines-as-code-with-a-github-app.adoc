= Using {pac} with a GitHub App

[role="_abstract"]
GitHub Apps act as a point of integration with {pipelines-title} and bring the advantage of Git-based workflows to {pipelines-shortname}. Cluster administrators can configure a single GitHub App for all cluster users. For GitHub Apps to work with {pac}, ensure that the webhook of the GitHub App points to the {pac} controller route (or ingress endpoint) that listens for GitHub events.

There are three ways to set up a GitHub app for {pac}:

* Use the `tkn` command line utility.
* Use the Administrator perspective of the web console.
* Set up the app manually in GitHub and then create a secret for {pac}.

By default, {pac} can communicate with one GitHub app. If you configured additional {pac} controllers to communicate with additional GitHub apps, configure each of the GitHub apps separately. You must set up GitHub apps for any additional controllers manually.
