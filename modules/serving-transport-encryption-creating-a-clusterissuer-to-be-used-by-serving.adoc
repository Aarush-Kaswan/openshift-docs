= Creating a ClusterIssuer to be used by Serving

To enable the use of certificates by Serving, you must create a cluster issuer.

.Procedure

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: knative-serving-ca-issuer
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: knative-serving-ca <1>
----
<1> Secret name in the {cert-manager-operator} namespace (`cert-manager` by default) containing the certificate that can be used by {ServerlessProductName} Serving components for new certificates.

. Apply the `ClusterIssuer` resource by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc apply -f <filename>
