= Serverless Operator maintenance release upgrades

== Latest and maintenance releases

Beginning with {ServerlessProductName} 1.29, the different product versions are available as follows:

* The latest release is available through the `stable` channel.
* The maintenance release is available through its version-based channel, for example, `stable-1.29`. 
+
[NOTE]
====
The maintenance release is the release prior to the latest release. For example, if the `stable` channel includes version 1.30, then the maintenance release will be available in the `stable-1.29` channel.
====

Using a version-based channel allows you to stay within a specific `x.y` stream. Additionally, it prevents an upgrade to the latest version of the product, which might contain breaking changes.

To switch to the maintenance release, update the channel parameter in the subscription object YAML file from `stable` to the corresponding version-based channel, such as `stable-1.29`.

== Patches and hotfixes for maintenance releases

As with the stable release, the maintenance release is subject to patches and hotfixes, which help to keep your deployment up to date with critical bug and security fixes.

* Patches are updates that are distributed as z-releases, for example, {ServerlessProductName} 1.29.1 is the patch that provides updates made since version 1.29.0.
* Hotfixes are fixes that require zero downtime and are used directly in production. They are different from the usual updates in that they upgrade the customer's deployed version, and not the latest released version.
+
Hotfixes might not be available to all customers immediately. However, changes introduced by hotfixes often become available to all customers as part of a future release.
+
When a hotfix pertaining to your deployment is available, you will be given the hotfix CatalogSource to update your subscription and obtain the hotfix.
+
After a new operator release is available, deployed operators with hotfixes can also be upgraded. To use the latest GA version, modify the subscription to use the public CatalogSource instead of the hotfix one.

The following diagram illustrates how patches and hotfixes work:

== Upgrade path for maintenance releases

If you use a version-based channel, you can always upgrade to the latest version in the channel, or head. For example, you can upgrade from 1.29.0 to 1.29.2 in the `stable-1.29` channel.

Additionally, from the head of the channel, you can upgrade to the next `x.y` release. For example, if 1.29.2 is the head in the `stable-1.29` channel, you can upgrade from 1.29.2 to 1.30. Such cross-channel updates are not done automatically, and the administrator needs to switch the channel manually by updating the subscription.

== Upgrade examples

=== Scenario 1

In this scenario, the following circumstances are true:

* The channel is `stable-1.28`
* You are switching to the `stable` channel
* The currently installed version is 1.28.0
* 1.29.0 was released before 1.28.1
* 1.30.0 is the head of the `stable` channel

The upgrade path from 1.28.0 on `stable-1.28` to 1.29.0 on `stable` in this scenario is 1.28.0 to 1.28.1 to 1.29.0.

=== Scenario 2

In this scenario, the following circumstances are true:

* The channel is `stable-1.29`
* The currently installed version is 1.29.0
* 1.29.1 was released to both the `stable-1.29` and `stable` channels before `1.30.0` was released to the `stable` channel

The upgrade path from 1.29.0 on `stable-1.29` to 1.30.0 on `stable` in this scenario is 1.29.0 to 1.29.1 to 1.30.0.

=== Scenario 3

In this scenario, the following circumstances are true:

* The channel is `stable-1.29`
* You are switching to the `stable-1.30` channel
* The currently installed version is 1.29.1
* 1.29.1 is the head of the `stable-1.29` channel

The upgrade path from 1.29.1 on `stable-1.29` to 1.30.0 on `stable-1.30` in this scenario is 1.29.1 to 1.30.0.
