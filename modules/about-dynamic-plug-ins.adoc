= About dynamic plugins

A dynamic plugin allows you to add custom pages and other extensions to your interface at runtime. The `ConsolePlugin` custom resource registers plugins with the console, and a cluster administrator enables plugins in the `console-operator` configuration.

[id="dynamic-plugins-features"]
== Key features

A dynamic plugin allows you to make the following customizations to the {product-title} experience:

* Add custom pages.
* Add perspectives and update navigation items.
* Add tabs and actions to resource pages.

== PatternFly 4 guidelines
When creating your plugin, follow these guidelines for using PatternFly:

* Use link:https://www.patternfly.org/v4/[PatternFly4] components and PatternFly CSS variables. Core PatternFly components are available through the SDK. Using PatternFly components and variables will help your plugin look consistent in future console versions.
* Make your plugin accessible by following link:https://www.patternfly.org/v4/accessibility/accessibility-fundamentals/[PatternFly's accessibility fundamentals].
* _Do not_ use other CSS libraries such as Bootstrap or Tailwind. They can conflict with PatternFly and will not match the console look and feel.

[id="general-plug-in-guidelines"]
== General guidelines
When creating your plugin, follow these general guidelines:

* Prefix your CSS class names with your plugin name to avoid collisions. For example, `my-plugin_\_heading` and `my-plugin_\_icon`.
* Maintain a consistent look, feel, and behavior with other console pages.
* Follow link:https://www.i18next.com/[react-i18next] localization guidelines when creating your plugin. You can use the `useTranslation` hook like the one in the following example:
+
[source,ymal]
----
conster Header: React.FC = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation('plugin__console-demo-plugin');
  return <h1>{t('Hello, World!')}</h1>;
};
----

* _Do not_ use console CSS classes in your markup or override console CSS classes. These are not APIs and are subject to change. Using them might break your plugin. Avoid selectors like element selectors that could affect markup outside of your pluginâ€™s components.
