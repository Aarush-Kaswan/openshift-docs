= Granting access to a user group

This procedure explains how to grant access to a user group. If your cluster has more advanced identity management configured, including user groups, you can grant all users of a specific group access to the {ols-long} service. 

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {ocp-product-title} web console as a user with the `cluster-admin` role. Alternatively, you are logged in as a user with the ability to grant permissions.

* You have deployed the {ols-long} service.

* You have access to the {ocp-short-name} CLI (oc).

.Procedure

. Run the following command at the command line:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group \
lightspeed-operator-query-access <group_name>
