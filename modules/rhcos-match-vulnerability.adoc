= Vulnerability matching

[role="_abstract"]
Central services, which include Central and Scanner, perform vulnerability matching. Scanner uses Red Hat's Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) v2 security data streams to match vulnerabilities on Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) software components.

Unlike the earlier versions, {product-title-short} 4.0 no longer uses the Kubernetes node metadata to find the kernel and container runtime versions. Instead, it uses the installed RHCOS RPMs to assess that information.
