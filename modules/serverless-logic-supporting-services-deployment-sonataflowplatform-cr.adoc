= Supporting services deployment with the SonataFlowPlatform CR

To deploy supporting services, configure the `dataIndex` and `jobService` subfields within the `spec.services` section of the `SonataFlowPlatform` custom resource (CR). This configuration instructs the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} to deploy each service when the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR is applied.

Each configuration of a service is handled independently, allowing you to customize these settings alongside other configurations in the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR.

See the following scaffold example configuration for deploying supporting services:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform-example
  namespace: example-namespace
spec:
  services:
    dataIndex: <1>
      enabled: true <2>
      # Specific configurations for the Data Index Service
      # might be included here
    jobService: <3>
      enabled: true <4>
      # Specific configurations for the Job Service
      # might be included here
----

<1> Data Index service configuration field.
<2> Setting `enabled: true` deploys the Data Index service. If set to `false` or omitted, the deployment will be disabled. The default value is `false`.
<3> Job Service configuration field.
<4> Setting `enabled: true` deploys the Job Service. If set to `false` or omitted, the deployment will be disabled. The default value is `false`.
