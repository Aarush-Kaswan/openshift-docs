= Configuring a histogram bucket

For the build controller, you can configure a histogram bucket by setting the value of the environment variable. When running the build controller locally, set the value of the environment variable right before starting it.

When deploying the build controller on the {ocp-product-title} cluster, you must add the environment variable in the `controller.yaml` deployment file. The environment variable values must be a comma-separated list of numbers.


.Procedure

* Add an entry for the environment variable in the `spec.containers[0].spec.env` section of the `controller.yaml` deployment file, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
