= {SMProductName} 3.0 Technology Preview

This release of {SMProductName} is Technology Preview.

// Simple table to help clarify for users the component versions they can use with OSSM 3.0 TP1. Likely a more complicated table will be needed for GA. OSSM 3.0 separates all the Operators such as OCP, Istio, Envoy, Kiali, OTEL/Tempo, etc. This is only what is known to work with OSSM 3.0 TP1.

== Unavailable clusters in this release

The following clusters are not supported in this Technology Preview release:

* Production clusters
* Clusters with {SMProductShortName} 2.x

// 09/12/2024: IBM Power and 390x platforms added to unavailable features per https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSSM-8068

// 08/22/2024: Possible more items may be added in the next week.
// Per Jira description from PM: "A bare bones release notes page to capture known features that are not currently available. As nothing is technically supported yet, "unsupported" doesn't really carry weight and the focus will be on features that are either unavailable of have not been tested yet in any manner."
// TP1 content. TP banner is persistent and was handled by a different PR from Tim O'Keefe. See https://docs.openshift.com/service-mesh/3.0.0tp1/about/ossm-about-openshift-service-mesh.html
// Possible file name may change
// Possible assembly file may change
// Assemblies, topic map info needs to be worked out still for 3.0.
// Noting for future reference: Rel notes for GA will have new features, bug fixes, etc. in addition to a Component table. Component table may be its own file as there are more components to update, including supported OCP versions since stand alone format removes the connection to the OCP version. Service Mesh docs are versioned now instead of OCP docs since stand alone moves Service Mesh docs up a level.
