== Installing {product-title-short} on Kubernetes platforms by using Helm charts

. Add the {product-title-short} Helm charts repository.
. Install the `central-services` Helm chart on the cluster that will contain Central, called the Central cluster.
. Log in to the {product-title-short} web console from the Central cluster and create an init bundle that you will install on the cluster that you want to secure, called the secured cluster.
. For each secured cluster:
.. Apply the init bundle you created with {product-title-short}. Log in to the secured cluster and run the `kubectl create -f <init_bundle>.yaml -n <stackrox>` command, specifying the path to the downloaded YAML file of the init bundle.
.. Install the `secured-cluster-services` Helm chart on the secured cluster, specifying the path to the init bundle that you created earlier.

== Installing {product-title-short} on Kubernetes platforms by using the `roxctl` CLI

This installation method is also called the _manifest installation method_.

. Install the `roxctl` CLI.
. On the Kubernetes cluster that will contain Central, perform these steps:
.. In the terminal window, run the interactive install command by using the `roxctl` CLI.
.. Run the setup shell script.
.. In the terminal window, create the Central resources by using the `kubectl create` command.
. Perform one of the following actions:
* In the {product-title-short} web console, create and download the sensor YAML file and keys.
* On the cluster that you want to secure, called the secured cluster, use the `roxctl sensor generate openshift` command.
. On the secured cluster, run the sensor installation script.
