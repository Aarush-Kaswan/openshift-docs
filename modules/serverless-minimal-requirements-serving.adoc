[id="serverless-minimal-requirements-serving_{context}"]
= Minimal requirements of {ServerlessProductName} Serving

While the default setup is suitable for medium-sized workloads, it might be over-sized for smaller setups or under-sized for high-workload scenarios.
To configure {ServerlessProductName} Serving for a minimal workload scenario, you need to know the idle consumption of the system components.

[id="serverless-minimal-requirements-serving-idle-consumption_{context}"]
== Idle consumption

The idle consumption is dependent on the number of Knative Services. The following memory usage has been measured for the components in the `knative-serving` and `knative-serving-ingress` {ocp-product-title} projects:

[cols=5*,options="header"]
|===
|Component
|0 Services
|100 Services
|500 Services
|1000 Services

|`activator`
|55Mi
|86Mi
|300Mi
|450Mi

|`autoscaler`
|52Mi
|102Mi
|225Mi

|`controller`

|`net-kourier-controller`
|90Mi

|430Mi

|===

[NOTE]
====
Either `3scale-kourier-gateway` and `net-kourier-controller` components or `istio-ingressgateway` and `net-istio-controller` components are installed. 

The memory consumption of `net-istio` is based on the total number of pods within the mesh.
