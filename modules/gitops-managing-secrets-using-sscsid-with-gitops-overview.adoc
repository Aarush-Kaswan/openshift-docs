= Overview of managing secrets using Secrets Store CSI driver with {gitops-shortname}

Some applications need sensitive information, such as passwords and usernames which must be concealed as good security practice. If sensitive information is exposed because role-based access control (RBAC) is not configured properly on your cluster, anyone with API or etcd access can retrieve or modify a secret. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Anyone who is authorized to create a pod in a namespace can use that RBAC to read any secret in that namespace. With the SSCSI Driver Operator, you can use an external secrets store to store and provide sensitive information to pods securely. 
====

The process of integrating the {OCP} SSCSI driver with the {gitops-shortname} Operator consists of the following procedures:

== Benefits
Integrating the SSCSI driver with the {gitops-shortname} Operator provides the following benefits:

* Enhance the security and efficiency of your {gitops-shortname} workflows
* Facilitate the secure attachment of secrets into deployment pods as a volume
* Ensure that sensitive information is accessed securely and efficiently

[id="secrets-store-providers_{context}"]
== Secrets store providers
The following secrets store providers are available for use with the Secrets Store CSI Driver Operator:

* AWS Secrets Manager
* AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
* Microsoft Azure Key Vault

As an example, consider that you are using AWS Secrets Manager as your secrets store provider with the SSCSI Driver Operator. The following example shows the directory structure in {gitops-shortname} repository that is ready to use the secrets from AWS Secrets Manager:
