= Cluster scoped supporting services 

You can define a cluster-wide set of supporting services that can be consumed by workflows across different namespaces, by using the `SonataFlowClusterPlatform` custom resource (CR). By referencing an existing namespace-specific `SonataFlowPlatform` CR, you can extend the use of these services cluster-wide.

You can use the following example of a basic configuration that enables workflows deployed in any namespace to utilize supporting services deployed in a specific namespace, such as `example-namespace`:

apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowClusterPlatform
metadata:
  name: cluster-platform

  platformRef:
    name: sonataflow-platform-example <1>
    namespace: example-namespace <2>
----

<1> Specifies the name of the already installed `SonataFlowPlatform` CR that manages the supporting services.
<2> Specifies the namespace of the `SonataFlowPlatform` CR that manages the supporting services.

[NOTE]
====
You can override these cluster-wide services within any namespace by configuring that namespace in `SonataFlowPlatform.spec.services`.
