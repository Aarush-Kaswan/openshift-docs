= Backup and disaster recovery

The {product-title-managed-short} Disaster Recovery strategy includes backups of database and any customization. This also applies to customer data stored in the Central database. Recovery time varies based on the number of appliances and database sizes; however, because the appliances can be clustered and distributed, the RTO can be reduced upfront with proper architecture planning.

All snapshots are created using the appropriate cloud provider snapshot APIs, encrypted and then uploaded to secure object storage, which for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is an S3 bucket.

* Red Hat does not commit to a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) or Recovery Time Objective (RTO). For more information, see link:https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Appendix_4_Red_Hat_Online_Services_20221213.pdf[PRODUCT APPENDIX 4 RED HAT ONLINE SERVICES].

* Site Reliability Engineering performs backups only as a precautionary measure. They are stored in the same region as the cluster.

* Customers should deploy multiple availability zone Secured Clusters with workloads that follow Kubernetes best practices to ensure high availability within a region.

Disaster recovery plans are exercised annually at a minimum. A Business Continuity Management standard and guideline is in place so that the BC lifecycle is consistently followed throughout the organization. This policy includes a requirement for testing at least annually, or with major change of functional plans. Review sessions are required to be conducted after any plan exercise or activation, and plan updates are made as needed.

Red Hat has generator backup systems. Our IT production systems are hosted in a Tier 3 data center facility that has recurring testing to ensure redundancy is operational. They are audited yearly to validate compliance.
