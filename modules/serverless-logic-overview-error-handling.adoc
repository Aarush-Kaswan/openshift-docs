= Error handling

OpenShift Serverless Logic allows you to define `explicit` error handling. You can define inside of your workflow model what should happen if errors occur rather than some generic error handling entity. Explicit error handling enables you to handle the errors that might happen during the interactions between the workflow and external systems. When an error occurs, it changes the regular workflow sequence. In these cases, a workflow state transitions to an alternative state that can potentially handle the error, instead of transitioning to the predefined state.

Each workflow state can define error handling, which is related only to errors that might arise during its execution. Error handling defined in one state cannot be used to handle errors that happened during execution of another state during workflow execution.

Unknown errors that may arise during workflow state execution that are not explicitly handled within the workflow definition should be reported by runtime implementations and halt workflow execution.

== Error definition 

An error definition in a workflow is composed of the `name` and `code` parameters. The `name` is a short and natural language description of an error, such as `wrong parameter`. The `code` parameter helps the implementation to identify the error.

The `code` parameter is mandatory and the engine uses different strategies to map the provided value to an exception encountered at runtime. The available strategies include FQCN, error message, and status code.

During workflow execution, you must handle the the known workflow errors in the workflow top-level `errors` property. This property can be either a `string` type, meaning it can reference a reusable `JSON` or `YAML` definition file including the error definitions, or it can have an `array` type where you can define these checked errors inline in your workflow definition.

The following examples show definitions for both types:
