= Overhead of {ServerlessProductName} Serving

As components of {ServerlessProductName} Serving are part of the data-plane, requests from clients are routed through:

* The ingress-gateway (Kourier or {SMProductShortName})
* The activator component
* The queue-proxy sidecar container in each Knative Service

These components introduce an additional hop in networking and perform additional tasks, for example, adding observability and request queuing. The following are the measured latency overheads:

* Each additional network hop adds 0.5 ms to 1 ms latency to a request. Depending on the current load of the Knative Service and if the Knative Service was scaled to zero before the request, the activator component is not always a part of the data-plane.
* Depending on the payload size, each of the components is consuming up to 1 vCPU of CPU for handling 2500 requests per second.
