= Using default security policies

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} includes a set of default policies that provide broad coverage to identify security issues and ensure best practices for security in your environment.

To view the default policies:

* In the {product-title-short} portal, go to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policy Management*.

The *Policies* view also enables you to configure the policies. 

The policy information is organized into the following groups:

* *Policy*: A name for the policy.
* *Description*: A longer, more detailed description of the alert for the policy.
* *Status*: The current status of the policy, either *Enabled* or *Disabled*.
* *Notifiers*: The list of notifiers that are configured for the policy.
* *Severity*: A ranking of the policy, either critical, high, medium, or low, for the amount of attention required.
* *Lifecycle*: The phase of the container lifecycle (build, deploy, or runtime) that this policy applies to, and the phase at which enforcement applies, when the policy is enabled.

The *Policy categories* view lists the categories and enables you to manage the categories for your policies. By default, all the categories are listed. You optionally filter the categories by using the category name.

The following categories are listed:

* Anomalous Activity
* Cryptocurrency Mining
* DevOps Best Practices
* Docker CIS
* Kubernetes
* Kubernetes Events
* Network Tools
* Package Management
* Privileges
* Security Best Practices
* Supply Chain Security
* System Modification
* Vulnerability Management
* Zero Trust
