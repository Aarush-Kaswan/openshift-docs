= Schema definitions

OpenShift Serverless Logic supports two types of schema definitions: input schema definition and output schema definition.

[id="input-schema-definition_{context}"]
== Input schema definition

The `dataInputSchema` parameter validates the workflow data input against a defined `JSON` Schema. It is important to provide `dataInputSchema`, as it is used to verify if the provided workflow data input is correct before any workflow states are executed.

You can define a `dataInputSchema` as follows:

.Example of `dataInputSchema` definition
[source,json]
----
"dataInputSchema": {
   "schema": "URL_to_json_schema",
   "failOnValidationErrors": false
}
----

The schema property is a URI, which holds the path to the JSON schema used to validate the workflow data input. The URI can be a classpath URI, a file, or an HTTP URL. If a classpath URI is specified, then the JSON schema file must be placed in the resources section of the project or any other directory included in the classpath.

The `failOnValidationErrors` is an optional flag that indicates the behavior adopted when the input data does not match the specified JSON schema. If not specified or set to `true`, an exception is thrown and flow execution fails. If set to `false`, the flow is executed and a log of level WARN with the validation errors is printed.

[id="output-schema-definition_{context}"]
== Output schema definition

Output schema definition is applied after workflow execution to verify that the output model has the expected format. It is also useful for Swagger generation purposes.

Similar to Input schema definition, you must specify the URL to the JSON schema, using `outputSchema` as follows:

.Example of `outputSchema` definition
[source,json]
----
"extensions" : [ {
      "extensionid": "workflow-output-schema",
      "outputSchema": {
         "schema" : "URL_to_json_schema",
          "failOnValidationErrors": false
     }
  } ]
----

The same rules described for `dataInputSchema` are applicable for `schema` and `failOnValidationErrors`. The only difference is that the latter flag is applied after workflow execution.
