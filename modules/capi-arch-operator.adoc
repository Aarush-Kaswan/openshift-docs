= The {cluster-capi-operator}

The {cluster-capi-operator} is an {product-title} Operator that maintains the lifecycle of Cluster API resources.
This Operator is responsible for all administrative tasks related to deploying the Cluster API project within an {product-title} cluster.

If a cluster is configured correctly to allow the use of the Cluster API, the {cluster-capi-operator} installs the Cluster API Operator on the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
The {cluster-capi-operator} is distinct from the upstream Cluster API Operator.

For more information, see the entry for the "{cluster-capi-operator}" in the _Cluster Operators reference_ content.
