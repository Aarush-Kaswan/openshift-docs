= Installing buildah strategy

You can install the `buildah` cluster build strategy, which does not require a daemon to run and is available for use by unprivileged users.

The `buildah` strategy is available for installation by using the following resources:

* `buildah-shipwright-managed-push`: This cluster build strategy allows storing the build image locally to perform additional processing tasks, such as the image vulnerability scanning, before the push. It requires that the image is stored to an output directory that can be processed. The `$(params.shp-output-directory)` system parameter defines the output directory for processing. 
* `buildah-strategy-managed-push`: This cluster build strategy contains the step to push the image to the target repository without any further processing.


.Prerequisites

* You have installed the `oc` CLI.

.Procedure

* To install the `buildah` strategy, run both or either of the following commands based on your needs:
