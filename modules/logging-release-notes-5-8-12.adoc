== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the collector used internal buffering with the `drop_newest` setting to reduce high memory usage, which caused significant log loss. With this update, the collector goes back to its default behavior, where `sink<>.buffer` is not customized. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6026[LOG-6026])
