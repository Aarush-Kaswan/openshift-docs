== Bug fixes

* Before this update, there was a delay in restarting Ingesters when configuring `LokiStack`, because the Loki Operator sets the write-ahead log `replay_memory_ceiling` to zero bytes for the `1x.demo` size. With this update, the minimum value used for the `replay_memory_ceiling` has been increased to avoid delays. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-5615[LOG-5615])
