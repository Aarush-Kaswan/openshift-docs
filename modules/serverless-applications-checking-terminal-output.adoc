= Checking terminal output

You can check your deploy command output to see whether deployment succeeded or not. If your deployment process was terminated, you should see an error message in the output that describes the reason why the deployment failed. This kind of failure is most likely due to either a misconfigured manifest or an invalid command.

.Procedure

* Open the command output on the client where you deploy and manage your application. The following example is an error that you might see after a failed `oc apply` command:
