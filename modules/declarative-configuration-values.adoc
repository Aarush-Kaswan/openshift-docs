= Declarative configuration values

[role=_abstract]
To use declarative configuration, you must create a YAML file (in this example, named "declarative-config-values.yaml") that adds the declarative configuration mounts to Central. This file is used in a Helm installation.

.Procedure
. Create the YAML file (in this example, named `declarative-config-values.yaml`) using the following example as a guideline:
+
[source,yaml]
----
central:
  declarativeConfiguration:
    mounts:
      configMaps:
        - declarative-configs
      secrets:
        - sensitive-declarative-configs
----
. Install the Central services Helm chart as documented in the "Installing the central-services Helm chart", referencing the `declarative-config-values.yaml` file.
