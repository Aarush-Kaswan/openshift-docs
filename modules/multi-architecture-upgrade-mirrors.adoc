= Upgrading a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines

To upgrade your cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, use the `candidate-{product-version}` update channel. For more information, see "Understanding upgrade channels".

[NOTE]
====
Only {product-title} clusters that are already using a multi-architecture payload can update with the `candidate-{product-version}` channel.
====

If you want to upgrade an existing cluster to support multi-architecture compute machines, you can perform an explicit upgrade command, as shown in the following procedure. This updates your current single-architecture cluster to a cluster that uses the multi-architecture payload.

.Prerequisites

* You installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure
* To manually upgrade your cluster, use the following command:
[source, terminal]

$ oc adm upgrade --allow-explicit-upgrade --to-image <image-pullspec> <1>
