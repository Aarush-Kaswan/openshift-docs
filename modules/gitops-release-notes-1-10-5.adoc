== Fixed issues

* Before this update, users could not use the `argocd-k8s-auth` binary to add Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters because this binary was not available in the {gitops-shortname} container. This update fixes the issue by adding the `argocd-k8s-auth` binary in the {gitops-shortname} container. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-4226[GITOPS-4226]

* Before this update, attempts to connect to Azure DevOps with Argo CD would result in an error due to the deprecation of the `rsa-ssh` host key algorithm by the Azure DevOps Repository service. This update fixes the issue by providing support for the `rsa-ssh` host key algorithms during the communication process between Argo CD and Azure DevOps Repository service. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-4543[GITOPS-4543]

* Before this update, the `ignoreDifferences` sync option in Argo CD did not work for array fields. This update fixes the issue by modifying the merge strategy of the `ignoreDifferences` sync option used in the upstream project to handle array fields. As a result, the sync option now functions correctly by allowing users to ignore specific elements in the array during sync. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-2962[GITOPS-2962]

* Before this update, users could not create custom resources for Argo CD from the *Add* page on the *Developer* perspective of the {gitops-title} web console. This issue has been observed from {gitops-title} 1.10 and later releases. This update fixes the issue because Operator-backed resources with the correct versions are included in the `ClusterServiceVersion` manifest file.
