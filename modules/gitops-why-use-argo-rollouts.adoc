= Why use Argo Rollouts?

As a cluster administrator, managing and coordinating advanced deployment strategies in traditional infrastructure often involves long maintenance windows. Automation with tools like {OCP} and {gitops-title} can reduce these windows, but setting up these strategies can still be challenging. 

Use Argo Rollouts to simplify progressive delivery by allowing application teams to define their rollout strategy declaratively. Teams no longer need to define multiple deployments and services or create automation for traffic shaping and integration of tests. 

You can use Argo Rollouts for the following reasons:

* Your users can more easily adopt progressive delivery in end-user environments.
* With the available structure and guidelines of Argo Rollouts, your teams do not have to learn about traffic managers and complex infrastructure.
* During an update, depending on your deployment strategy, you can optimize the existing traffic-shaping abilities of the deployed application versions by gradually shifting traffic to the new version. 
* You can combine Argo Rollouts with a metric provider like Prometheus to do metric-based and policy-driven rollouts and rollbacks based on the parameters set. 
* Your end-user environments get the {gitops-title} Operator's security and help to manage the resources, cost, and time effectively.
* Your existing users who use Argo CD with security and automated deployments get feedback early in the process that they can use to avoid problems that impact them.

== Benefits of Argo Rollouts

Using Argo Rollouts as a default workload in {gitops-title} provides the following benefits:

* Automated progressive delivery as part of the {gitops-shortname} workflow
* Advanced deployment capabilities
* Optimize the existing advanced deployment strategies such as blue-green or canary
* Zero downtime updates for deployments
* Fine-grained, weighted traffic shifting
* Able to test without any new traffic hitting the production environment
* Automated rollbacks and promotions
* Manual judgment
* Customizable metric queries and analysis of business key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Integration with ingress controller and {SMProductName} for advanced traffic routing
* Integration with metric providers for deployment strategy analysis
* Usage of multiple providers
