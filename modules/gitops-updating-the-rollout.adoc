= Updating the rollout

When you update the `Rollout` custom resource (CR) with modifications to the `.spec.template.spec` fields, for example, the container image version, then new pods are created through the `ReplicaSet` by using the updated container image version.

.Procedure 

. Simulate the new canary version of the application by modifying the container image deployed in the rollout.
.. In the *Administrator* perspective of the web console, go to *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* -> *{gitops-title}* -> *Rollout*.
.. Select the existing `rollouts-demo` rollout and modify the `.spec.template.spec.containers.image` value from `argoproj/rollouts-demo:blue` to `argoproj/rollouts-demo:yellow` in the YAML view.
.. Click *Save* and then click *Reload*.
+
The container image deployed in the rollout is modified and the rollout initiates a new canary deployment.
+
[NOTE]
====
As per the `setWeight` property defined in the `.spec.strategy.canary.steps` field of the `Rollout` CR, initially 20% of traffic to the route reaches the canary version and the rollout is paused indefinitely until a request for promotion is received.

<1> The deployment strategy that the rollout must use.
<2> The steps for the rollout. This example gradually routes 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of traffic to the canary version.
<3> The percentage of traffic that must be directed to the canary version. A value of 20 means that 20% of traffic is directed to the canary version.
<4> Specification to the Argo Rollouts controller to pause indefinitely until it finds a request for promotion.

. Watch the progression of your rollout by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc argo rollouts get rollout rollouts-demo --watch -n <namespace> <1>
----
<1> Specify the namespace where the `Rollout` CR is defined.

The rollout is now in a paused status, because there is no pause duration specified in the rollout's update strategy configuration.

. Repeat the previous step to test the newly deployed version of application and ensure that it is working as expected. For example, verify the application by interacting with the application through the browser and try running tests or observing container logs.
+
The rollout will remain paused until you advance it to the next step. 

After you verify that the new version of the application is working as expected, you can decide whether to continue with promotion or to abort the rollout. Accordingly, follow the instructions in "Promoting the rollout" or "Manually aborting the rollout".
