= Checking route status

In some cases, the `Route` object has issues. You can check its status by using the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).

.Procedure

* View the status of the `Route` object with which you deployed your application by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get route <route_name> --output yaml
----
+
Substitute `<route_name>` with the name of your `Route` object.
+
The `conditions` object in the `status` object states the reason in case of a failure.
