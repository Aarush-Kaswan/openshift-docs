= Adding a SelfSigned ClusterIssuer resource to CA trust bundles

If you are using a `SelfSigned` `ClusterIssuer` resource, you can add the CA to the Eventing CA trust bundles. 

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.
* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName}.
* You have installed the {cert-manager-operator}.
* You have installed the OpenShift (`oc`) CLI.

.Procedure

. Export the CA from the `knative-eventing-ca` secret in the {cert-manager-operator} namespace (default is `cert-manager` certificate) by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get secret -n cert-manager knative-eventing-ca -o=jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ca.crt
----

. Create a CA trust bundle in the `knative-eventing` namespace by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create configmap -n knative-eventing my-org-selfsigned-ca-bundle --from-file=ca.crt
----

. Label the `ConfigMap` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label configmap -n knative-eventing my-org-selfsigned-ca-bundle networking.knative.dev/trust-bundle=true
