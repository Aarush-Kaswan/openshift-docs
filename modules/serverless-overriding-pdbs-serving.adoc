= Overriding disruption budgets

A Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) is a standard feature of Kubernetes APIs that helps limit the disruption to an application when its pods need to be rescheduled for maintenance reasons.

.Procedure

* Override the default PDB for a specific resource by modifying the `minAvailable` configuration value in the `KnativeServing` custom resource (CR).

.Example PDB with a `minAvailable` seting of 70%

[NOTE]
====
If you disable high-availability, for example, by changing the `high-availability.replicas` value to `1`, make sure you also update the corresponding PDB `minAvailable` value to `0`. Otherwise, the pod disruption budget prevents automatic cluster or Operator updates.
