= Modifying a machine set by using the CLI

When you modify a machine set, your changes only apply to machines that are created after you save the updated `MachineSet` custom resource (CR).
The changes do not affect existing machines.
You can replace the existing machines with new ones that reflect the updated configuration by scaling the machine set.

If you need to scale a machine set without making other changes, you do not need to delete the machines.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the {product-title} router pods are deployed on machines.
Because the router is required to access some cluster resources, including the web console, do not scale the machine set to `0` unless you first relocate the router pods.
====

.Prerequisites

* Your {product-title} cluster uses the Machine API.

* You are logged in to the cluster as an administrator by using the {oc-first}.

.Procedure

. Edit the machine set:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit machineset <machine_set_name> -n openshift-machine-api
----

. Note the value of the `spec.replicas` field, as you need it when scaling the machine set to apply the changes.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: MachineSet
metadata:
  name: <machine_set_name>
  namespace: openshift-machine-api
spec:
  replicas: 2 # <1>
# ...
----
<1> The examples in this procedure show a machine set that has a `replicas` value of `2`.

. Update the machine set CR with the configuration options that you want and save your changes.

. List the machines that are managed by the updated machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-machine-api machines -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset=<machine_set_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
NAME                        PHASE     TYPE         REGION      ZONE         AGE
<machine_name_original_1>   Running   m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   4h
<machine_name_original_2>   Running   m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   4h
----

. For each machine that is managed by the updated machine set, set the `delete` annotation by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate machine/<machine_name_original_1> \
  -n openshift-machine-api \
  machine.openshift.io/delete-machine="true"
----

. Scale the machine set to twice the number of replicas by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=4 \// <1>
  machineset <machine_set_name> \
  -n openshift-machine-api
----
<1> The original example value of `2` is doubled to `4`.

. List the machines that are managed by the updated machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-machine-api machines -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset=<machine_set_name>
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
NAME                        PHASE          TYPE         REGION      ZONE         AGE
<machine_name_original_1>   Running        m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   4h
<machine_name_original_2>   Running        m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   4h
<machine_name_updated_1>    Provisioned    m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   55s
<machine_name_updated_2>    Provisioning   m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   55s
----
+
When the new machines are in the `Running` phase, you can scale the machine set to the original number of replicas.

. Scale the machine set to the original number of replicas by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 \// <1>
  machineset <machine_set_name> \
  -n openshift-machine-api
----
<1> The original example value of `2`.

.Verification

* To verify that the machines without the updated configuration are deleted, list the machines that are managed by the updated machine set by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get -n openshift-machine-api machines -l machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset=<machine_set_name>
----
+
.Example output while deletion is in progress

<machine_name_original_2>   Deleting        m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   4h

NAME                        PHASE           TYPE         REGION      ZONE         AGE
<machine_name_updated_1>    Running         m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   6m30s
<machine_name_updated_2>    Running         m6i.xlarge   us-west-1   us-west-1a   6m30s
----

* To verify that a machine created by the updated machine set has the correct configuration, examine the relevant fields in the CR for one of the new machines by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc describe machine <machine_name_updated_1> -n openshift-machine-api
