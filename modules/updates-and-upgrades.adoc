= Updates and Upgrades

Red{nbsp}Hat makes a commercially reasonable effort to notify customers prior to updates and upgrades that impact service.
The decision regarding the need for a Service update to the Central instance and its timing is the sole responsibility of Red{nbsp}Hat.

Customers have no control over when a Central service update occurs. For more information, see link:https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Appendix_4_Red_Hat_Online_Services_20221213.pdf[PRODUCT APPENDIX 4 RED HAT ONLINE SERVICES].
Upgrades to the version of {rh-rhacscs-first} are considered part of the service update. Upgrades are transparent to the customer and no connection to any update site is required.

Customers are responsible for timely {product-title-short} Secured Cluster services upgrades that are required to maintain compatibility with {product-title-managed-short}.

Red{nbsp}Hat recommends enabling automatic upgrades for Secured Clusters that are connected to {product-title-managed-short}.

See the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/7045053[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes Support Matrix] for more information about upgrade versions.
