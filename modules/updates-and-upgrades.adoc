= Updates and Upgrades

Red{nbsp}Hat makes a commercially reasonable effort to notify customers prior to updates and upgrades that impact service.
The decision regarding the need for a Service update to the Central instance and its timing is the sole responsibility of Red{nbsp}Hat.

Customers have no control over when a Central service update occurs. For more information, see link:https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Appendix_4_Red_Hat_Online_Services_20221213.pdf[PRODUCT APPENDIX 4 RED HAT ONLINE SERVICES].
Upgrades to the version of {rh-rhacscs-first} are considered part of the service update.

The version of {product-title-managed-short} used on Secured Clusters must match the version of the Central instance of {product-title-managed-short} to ensure compatibility.
Customers are responsible for Secured Cluster services upgrades required to maintain this version compatibility.
