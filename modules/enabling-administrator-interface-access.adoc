= Enabling administrator interface access

You can change the envoy bootstrap configuration to enable access to the administrator interface.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This procedure assumes sufficient knowledge of Knative, as changing envoy bootstrap configuration might result in Knative failure. Red Hat does not support custom configurations that are not tested or shipped with the product.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName} and Knative Serving.
* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.

.Procedure

. To enable administrator interface access, locate this configuration in your bootstrapping configuration map:
+
[source,terminal]
----
pipe:
  path: /tmp/envoy.admin
----
+
Substitute it with the following configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
socket_address: <1>
  address: 127.0.0.1
  port_value: 9901
----
<1> This configuration enables access to the Envoy admin interface on the loopback address (127.0.0.1) and port 9901.
+
. Apply the `socket_address` configuration in the `service_stats` cluster configuration and in the `admin` configuration:
.. The first is in the `service_stats` cluster configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
clusters:
  - name: service_stats
    connect_timeout: 0.250s
    type: static
    load_assignment:
      cluster_name: service_stats
      endpoints:
        lb_endpoints:
          endpoint:
            address:
              socket_address:
                address: 127.0.0.1
                port_value: 9901
----
+
.. The second is in the `admin` configuration:
+
[source,terminal]
----
admin:
  access_log:
    - name: envoy.access_loggers.stdout
      typed_config:
        "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.access_loggers.stream.v3.StdoutAccessLog
  address:
    socket_address:
      address: 127.0.0.1
      port_value: 9901
