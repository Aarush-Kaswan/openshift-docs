= Administration event details overview

The administration event provides log information that describes the error or event. 

The logs provide the following information:

* Context of the event
* Steps to take to fix the error

The administration event page organizes information in the following groups:

* *Resource type*: Classifies events based on the resource or component type involved.
+ 
The following resource types are included:

** `API Token`
** `Cluster` 
** `Image`
** `Node`
** `Notifier`

* *Resource name*: Specifies the name of the resource or component to which the event refers. It identifies the specific instance within the domain where the event occurred.

* *Event type*: Specifies the source of the event. Central generates log events that correspond to administration events created from log statements.

* *Event ID*: A unique identifier composed of alphanumeric characters that is assigned to each event. Event IDs can be useful in identifying, tracking, and managing events over time.

* *Created at*: Indicates the timestamp and date when the event was originally created or recorded.

* *Last occurred at*: Specifies the timestamp and date when the event last occurred. This tracks the timing of the event, which can be critical for diagnosing and fixing recurring issues.

* *Count*: Indicates the number of times a particular event occurred. This number is useful in assessing the frequency of an issue. An event that has occurred multiple times indicates a persistent issue that you need to fix.
