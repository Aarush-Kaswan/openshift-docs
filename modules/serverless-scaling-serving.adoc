= Scaling and performance of {ServerlessProductName} Serving

{ServerlessProductName} Serving has to be scaled and configured based on the following parameters:

* Number of Knative Services
* Number of Revisions
* Amount of concurrent requests in the system
* Size of payloads of the requests
* The startup-latency and response latency of the Knative Service added by the user's web application
* Number of changes of the KnativeService custom resource (CR) over time

[id="serverless-scaling-serving-defaults_{context}"]
== KnativeServing default configuration 

Per default, {ServerlessProductName} Serving is configured to run all components with high-availability and medium-sized CPU and memory requests and limits. This means that the `high-available` field in `KnativeServing` CR is automatically set to a value of `2` and all system components are scaled to two replicas. This configuration is suitable for medium workload scenarios and has been tested with:

* 170 Knative Services
* 1-2 Revisions per Knative Service
* 89 test scenarios mainly focused on testing the control plane
* 48 re-creating scenarios where Knative Services are deleted and re-created
* 41 stable scenarios, in which requests are slowly but continuously sent to the system

During these test cases, the system components effectively consumed:
