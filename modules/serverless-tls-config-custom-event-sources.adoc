= Configure custom event sources to trust the Eventing CA

To create a custom event source, use a SinkBinding. The SinkBinding can inject the configured CA trust bundles as a projected volume into each container by using the `knative-custom-certs` directory.

In specific cases, you might inject company-specific CA trust bundles into base container images and automatically configure runtimes, such as OpenJDK or Node.js, and so on. to trust those CA bundles. In such cases, you might not need to configure your clients.

By using the `my_org_eventing_bundle` config map from the previous example, with the `ca.crt`, `ca1.crt`, and `tls.crt` data keys, the `knative-custom-certs` directory has the following layout:

[source,terminal]
----
/knative-custom-certs/ca.crt
/knative-custom-certs/ca1.crt
/knative-custom-certs/tls.crt
----

You can use these files to add CA trust bundles to HTTP clients that send events to Eventing.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on the runtime, programming language, or library you use, different methods exist for configuring custom CA cert files, such as using command-line flags, environment variables, or reading the content of the files.
