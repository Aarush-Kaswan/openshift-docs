= About {product-title}

{product-title} is for organizations that need small-form-factor edge devices and support for bare metal, virtualized, or containerized applications. {product-title} helps address many of the emerging questions around large-scale edge computing at the device edge by incorporating Kubernetes features in a new, smaller, lighter-weight footprint with an edge-optimized Linux operating system built from the world's leading enterprise Linux platform in {op-system}. You can manage {product-title} using {ansible}.

[id="device-edge-compatibility_{context}"]
== {product-title} product release compatibility matrix

{op-system-first} and {microshift} work together as a single solution for device-edge computing. You can update each component separately, but the product versions must be compatible. For example, an update of {microshift} from 4.14 to 4.16 requires a {op-system} update. Supported configurations of {product-title} use verified releases for each together as listed in the following table:
