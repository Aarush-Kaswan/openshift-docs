You can use the `ko` cluster builder strategy to build an image from a Golang main package. To control the `ko` build strategy functioning, you can configure the following parameters in your `Build` or `BuildRun` CR:

* `go-flags`: The value for the `GOFLAGS` environment variable. The default value is `empty`.
* `go-version`: The version of the `Go` strategy. The parameter value must match a tag from the golang image. The default value is `1.18`.
* `ko-version`:  The version of the `ko` strategy. The default value is `latest`.
* `package-directory`: The directory inside the context directory that contains the `main` package.
* `target-platform`: The target platform that you build, such as, `linux/arm64`. You can also provide multiple platforms separated by a comma, for example, `linux/arm64`,`linux/amd64`. The value `all` builds all platforms supported by the base image. The value `current` builds the platform on which the current build runs.
* `gocache`: The volume to contain the `GOCACHE` environment variable. You can set the parameter value to a persistent volume to optimize compilation performance for rebuilds. The default value is an `emptyDir` volume, which means that the cached data is discarded at the end of a build run.
