= Conflict with the existing filter field

You can use the `filters` and the existing `filter` field at the same time. If you enable the new `new-trigger-filters` feature and an object contains both `filter` and `filters`, the `filters` field overrides. This setup allows you to test the new `filters` field while maintaining support for existing filters. You can gradually introduce the new field into existing trigger objects.

.Example of `filters` field overriding the `filter` field:
[source,yaml]

  # Existing filter field. This will be ignored when the new filters field is present.
  filter:
    attributes:
      type: dev.knative.foo.bar
      myextension: my-extension-value
  # New filters field. This takes precedence over the old filter field.
  filters:
    - cesql: "type = 'dev.knative.foo.bar' AND myextension = 'my-extension-value'"
