= Editing a workflow

When the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} deploys a workflow service, it creates two config maps to store runtime properties:

* User properties: Defined in a `ConfigMap` named after the `SonataFlow` object with the suffix `-props`. For example, if your workflow name is `greeting`, then the `ConfigMap` name is `greeting-props`.

* Managed properties: Defined in a `ConfigMap` named after the `SonataFlow` object with the suffix `-managed-props`. For example, if your workflow name is `greeting`, then the `ConfigMap` name is `greeting-managed-props`.

[NOTE]
====
Managed properties always override any user property with the same key name and cannot be edited by the user. Any change would be overwritten by the Operator at the next reconciliation cycle.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} installed on your cluster.
* You have access to a {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI `(oc)`.

.Procedure

. Open and edit the `ConfigMap` by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit cm <workflow_name>-props -n <namespace>
----
+
Replace `<workflow_name>` with the name of your workflow and `<namespace>` with the namespace where your workflow is deployed.

. Add the properties in the `application.properties` section.
+
.Example of a workflow properties stored within a `ConfigMap`:
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app: greeting
  name: greeting-props
  namespace: default
data:
  application.properties: |
    my.properties.key = any-value
----
+
Ensure the properties are correctly formatted to prevent the Operator from replacing your configuration with the default one.

. After making the necessary changes, save the file and exit the editor.
