== Bug fixes
* Before this update, a time range could not be selected in the {Product-Title} web console by clicking and dragging over the logs histogram. With this update, clicking and dragging can be used to successfully select a time range. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4102[LOG-4102])

* Before this update, clicking on the *Show Resources* link in the {Product-Title} web console did not produce any effect. With this update, the issue is resolved by fixing the functionality of the *Show Resources* link to toggle the display of resources for each log entry. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4117[LOG-4117])
