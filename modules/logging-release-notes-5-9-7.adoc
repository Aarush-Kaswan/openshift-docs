== Bug fixes

* Before this update, the `clusterlogforwarder.spec.outputs.http.timeout` parameter was not applied to the Fluentd configuration when Fluentd was used as the collector type, causing HTTP timeouts to be misconfigured. With this update, the `clusterlogforwarder.spec.outputs.http.timeout` parameter is now correctly applied, ensuring Fluentd honors the specified timeout and handles HTTP connections according to the userâ€™s configuration. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6125[LOG-6125])

* Before this update, the TLS section was added without verifying the broker URL schema, resulting in SSL connection errors if the URLs did not start with `tls`. With this update, the TLS section is now added only if the broker URLs start with `tls`, preventing SSL connection errors. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6041[LOG-6041])
