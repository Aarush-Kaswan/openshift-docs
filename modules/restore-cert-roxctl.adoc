= Restore certificates using the roxctl CLI

[role="_abstract"]
Use the `roxctl` CLI to generate Kubernetes manifests to install the {product-title-short} Central component to your cluster.
Doing this allows you to ensure that authentication certificates for Secured clusters and the API tokens remain valid for the restored version.
If you backed up another instance of {product-title-short} Central, you can use the certificate files from that backup.

[NOTE]
====
With the `roxctl` CLI, you can not restore the entire Central deployment. Instead, first you use the `roxctl` CLI to generate new manifests using the certificates in your central data backup. Afterwards, you use those manifests to install Central.
====

.Prerequisites
* You must have the {product-title} backup file.
* You must have installed the `roxctl` CLI.

.Procedure
. Run the interactive install command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl central generate interactive
----
. For the following prompt, enter the path of the {product-title} backup file:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Enter path to the backup bundle from which to restore keys and certificates (optional): _<backup-file-path>_
----
. For other following prompts, press kbd:[Enter] to accept the default value or enter custom values as required.

On completion, the interactive install command creates a folder named `central-bundle`, which has the necessary YAML manifests and scripts to deploy Central.
