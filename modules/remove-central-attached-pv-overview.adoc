= Remove Central-attached PV

[role="_abstract"]
Kubernetes and {ocp} do not delete persistent volumes (PV) automatically. When you upgrade {product-title-short} from earlier versions, the Central PV called `stackrox-db` remains mounted. However, in {product-title-short} 4.1, Central does not need the previously attached PV anymore.

The PV has data and persistent files used by earlier {product-title-short} versions. You can use the PV to roll back to an earlier version before {product-title-short} 4.1. Or, if you have a large RocksDB backup bundle for Central, you can use the PV to restore that data.

If you do not plan to roll back or restore from earlier RocksDB backups, you can remove the Central-attached persistent volume claim (PVC) to free up the storage.

[WARNING]
====
After removing PVC, you cannot roll back Central to an earlier version before {product-title-short} 4.1 or restore large RocksDB backups created with RocksDB.
