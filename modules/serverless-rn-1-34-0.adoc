[id="new-features-1-34-0_{context}"]
== New features

* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 1.14.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Eventing 1.14.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Kourier 1.14.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative (`kn`) CLI 1.14.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative for Apache Kafka 1.14.
* The `kn func` CLI plugin now uses `func` 1.15.

* {ServerlessLogicProductName} now supports multiple configuration for OpenAPI within the same namespace.

* The management console for {ServerlessLogicProductName} is now available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature for streamlining the development process.

* {ServerlessLogicProductName} 1.34 introduces a new feature that allows workflows to access different {ocp-product-title} clusters through configuration. This feature enables users to define REST calls within a workflow to seamlessly interact with multiple clusters.

* In {ServerlessLogicProductName}, the Job Service liveness checks is now enhanced to limit the time required to retrieve the leader status. A new system property, `kogito.jobs-service.management.leader-check.expiration-in-seconds`, has been introduced, allowing you to configure the maximum time allowed for the leader status check.

* Automatic `EventType` registration is an Eventing feature is now available as a Technology Preview (TP). It automatically creates `EventTypes` objects based on processed events on the broker ingress and in-memory channels, improving the experience of consuming and creating `EventTypes`.

* Encryption Serving is now available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature.

* Startup probes are now supported, helping to reduce cold start times for faster application startup and improved performance. These probes are particularly useful for containers with slow startup processes.

* {ServerlessProductName} Serving transport encryption feature allows transporting data over secured and encrypted HTTPS connections using TLS. This is now available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature.

* Go functions using S2I builder are now available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature for Linux and Mac developers, allowing them to implement and build Go functions on these platforms.

* Multi-container support for Knative Serving allows you to use a single Knative service to deploy a multi-container pod. It also supports the `readiness` and `liveness` probe values for multiple containers.

* Autoscaling for Knative Kafka triggers is now enhanced with KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) as a Technology Preview (TP). Autoscaling using CMA/KEDA further enhances performance by optimizing resource allocation for Kafka triggers and `KafkaSource` objects, ensuring better scalability in event-driven workloads.

* Knative Eventing now offers support for data in transit encryption (Eventing TLS) as a Technology Preview (TP) feature. You can configure Knative Eventing components to expose HTTPS addresses as well as add user-provided CA trust bundles to clients.

== Fixed issues

* Previously, `KafkaSource` objects would incorrectly remain in the `Ready` status even when the `KafkaSource.spec.net.tls.key` failed to load. This issue has been resolved. An error is now reported when creating a Kafka `Broker`, `KafkaChannel`, `KafkaSource`, or `KafkaSink` object with unsupported TLS certificates in PKCS #1 (Public-Key Cryptography Standards #1) format, ensuring proper handling and notification of configuration issues.

* The Eventing controller incorrectly requeued the wrong object type (`Namespace`), causing "resource not found" log errors. This issue is now resolved, and the controller now handles object requeuing, ensuring more accurate logging and resource management.
