== Bug fixes
* Before this update, the LokiStack gateway cached authorized requests very broadly. As a result, this caused wrong authorization results. With this update, LokiStack gateway caches on a more fine-grained basis which resolves this issue. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-4435[LOG-4435])
