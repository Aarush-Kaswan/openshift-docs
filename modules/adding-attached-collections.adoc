= Adding attached collections

Grouping collections and adding them to other collections can be useful if you want to create small collections based on deployments. You can reuse and combine those smaller collections into larger, hierarchical collections. To add additional collections to a collection that you are creating:

. Perform one of the following actions:
* Enter text in the *Filter by name* field and press *->* to view matching results. 
* Click the name of a collection from the *Available collections* list to view information about the collection, such as the name and rules for the collection and the deployments that match that collection. 
. After viewing collection information, close the window to return to the *Attached collections* page.
. Click *+Attach*. The *Attached collections* section lists the collections that you attached.

[NOTE]
====
When you add an attached collection, the attached collection contains results based on the configured selection rules. For example, if an attached collection includes resources that would be filtered out by the rules used in the parent collection, then those items are still added to the parent collection because of the rules in the attached collection. Attached collections extend the original collection using an `OR` operator.
