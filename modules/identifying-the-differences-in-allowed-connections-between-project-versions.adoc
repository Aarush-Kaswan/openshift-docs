= Identifying the differences in allowed connections between project versions

This command helps you understand the differences in allowed connections between two project versions. It analyses the workload and Kubernetes network policy manifests located in each version's directory and creates a representation of the differences in text format.

You can view connectivity difference reports in a variety of output formats, including `text`, `md`, and `csv`.
