== Fixed issues

* Previously, creating Knative installation resources like `KnativeServing` or `KnativeEventing` in a user namespace triggered an infinite reconciliation loop in the {ServerlessOperatorName}. This issue has been resolved by reintroducing an admission webhook that prevents the creation of Knative installation resources in any namespace other than `knative-serving` or `knative-eventing`.

* Previously, post-install batch jobs were removed after a certain period, leaving privileged service accounts unbound. This caused compliance systems to flag the issue. The problem has been resolved by retaining completed jobs, ensuring that service accounts remain bound.
