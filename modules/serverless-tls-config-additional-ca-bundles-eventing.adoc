= Configuring additional CA trust bundles

By default, Eventing clients trust the OpenShift CA bundle configured for custom PKI. For more details, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/networking/configuring-a-custom-pki.html[Configuring a custom PKI].

[NOTE]
====
When a new connection is established, Eventing clients automatically include these CA bundles in their trusted list.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions on {ocp-product-title}, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on {rosa-product-title} or {dedicated-product-title}.
* You have installed the {ServerlessOperatorName}.
* You have installed the {cert-manager-operator}.

.Procedure

* Create a CA bundle for Eventing as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: <my_org_eventing_bundle> <1>
  namespace: knative-eventing
  labels:
    networking.knative.dev/trust-bundle: "true"
data: <2>
  ca.crt: ...
  ca1.crt: ...
  tls.crt: ...
----
<1> Use a unique name to avoid conflicts with existing or future Eventing config maps.
<2> All keys with valid PEM-encoded CA bundles are trusted by Eventing clients.
