= Setting custom volume size

For projects that require a volume with a larger size to build, you might need to customize the persistent volume claim (PVC) when building on the cluster. The default PVC size is 256 mebibytes.

.Prerequisites

* {pipelines-title} must be installed on your cluster.

* You have installed the OpenShift (`oc`) CLI.

* You have installed the Knative (`kn`) CLI.

.Procedure

* Deploy your function with the `--pvc-size` flag and PVC size specification by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kn func deploy --remote --pvc-size='2Gi'
----
+
In this example, PVC is set to two gibibytes.
