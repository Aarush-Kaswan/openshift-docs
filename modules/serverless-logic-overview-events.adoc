= Events

An event state consists of one or more event definitions. Event definitions are combined to designate the `CloudEvent` types that the event state listens to. You can use the event state to start a new workflow instance upon the reception of a designated `CloudEvent`, or to pause the execution of an existing workflow instance until a designated `CloudEvent` is received.

In an event state definition, the `onEvents` property is used to group the `CloudEvent` types that might trigger the same set of `actions`. The `exclusive` property in an event definition indicates how an event match is calculated. If the value of `exclusive` property is `false`, then all `CloudEvent` types in the `eventRefs` array must be received for a match to occur. Otherwise, the reception of any referenced `CloudEvent` type is considered a match.

The following example shows event definitions, consisting of two CloudEvent types, including `noisy` and `silent`:

.Example of event definition
[source,json]
----
"events": [
    {
      "name": "noisyEvent",
      "source": "",
      "type": "noisy",
      "dataOnly" : "false"
    },
    {
      "name": "silentEvent",
      "source": "",
      "type": "silent"
    }
  ]
----

To indicate that an event match occurs when both `noisy` and `silent` CloudEvent types are received and to execute different actions for both CloudEvent types, define an event state containing both event definitions in separate `onEvent` items and set the `exclusive` property to false.
