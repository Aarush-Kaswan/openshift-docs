= Build run status

The `BuildRun` resource updates whenever the image building status changes, as shown in the following examples:

.Example: BuildRun with Unknown status
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get buildrun buildpacks-v3-buildrun
NAME                    SUCCEEDED   REASON    MESSAGE   STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
buildpacks-v3-buildrun  Unknown     Pending   Pending   1s
----

.Example: BuildRun with True status
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get buildrun buildpacks-v3-buildrun
NAME                    SUCCEEDED   REASON      MESSAGE                              STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
buildpacks-v3-buildrun  True        Succeeded   All Steps have completed executing   4m28s       16s
----

A `BuildRun` resource stores the status-related information in the `status.conditions` field. For example, a condition with the type `Succeeded` indicates that resources have successfully completed their operation. The `status.conditions` field includes significant information like status, reason, and message for the `BuildRun` resource.
