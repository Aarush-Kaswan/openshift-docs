= oc-mirror compatibility and support

The oc-mirror plug-in supports mirroring {product-title} payload images and Operator catalogs for {product-title} versions 4.9 and later.

Use the latest available version of the oc-mirror plug-in regardless of which versions of {product-title} you need to mirror.

// TODO: remove this note for 4.12
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you used the Technology Preview version of the oc-mirror plug-in for {product-title} 4.10, it is not possible to migrate your mirror registry to {product-title} 4.11. You must download the new oc-mirror plug-in, use a new storage back end, and use a new top-level namespace on the target mirror registry.
