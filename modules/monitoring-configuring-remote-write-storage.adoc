= Configuring remote write storage

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure remote write storage to enable Prometheus to send ingested metrics to remote systems for long-term storage.
Doing so has no impact on how or for how long Prometheus stores metrics.

.Prerequisites

* *If you are configuring core {product-title} monitoring components:*
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role.
** You have created the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
* *If you are configuring components that monitor user-defined projects:*
** You have access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` cluster role or as a user with the `user-workload-monitoring-config-edit` role in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` project.
** A cluster administrator has enabled monitoring for user-defined projects.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI (`oc`).
* You have set up a remote write compatible endpoint (such as Thanos) and know the endpoint URL.
See the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage[Prometheus remote endpoints and storage documentation] for information about endpoints that are compatible with the remote write feature.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Red{nbsp}Hat only provides information for configuring remote write senders and does not offer guidance on configuring receiver endpoints. Customers are responsible for setting up their own endpoints that are remote-write compatible. Issues with endpoint receiver configurations are not included in Red{nbsp}Hat production support.
====
* You have set up authentication credentials in a `Secret` object for the remote write endpoint.
You must create the secret in the same namespace as the Prometheus object for which you configure remote write:  the `openshift-monitoring` namespace for default platform monitoring or the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace for user workload monitoring.

+
[WARNING]
====
To reduce security risks, use HTTPS and authentication to send metrics to an endpoint.
====

.Procedure

Follow these steps to configure remote write for default platform monitoring in the `cluster-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace.

[NOTE]
====
If you configure remote write for the Prometheus instance that monitors user-defined projects, make similar edits to the `user-workload-monitoring-config` config map in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.
Note that the Prometheus config map component is called `prometheus` in the `user-workload-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object and not `prometheusK8s`, as it is in the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object.
====

. Edit the `cluster-monitoring-config` `ConfigMap` object in the `openshift-monitoring` project:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n openshift-monitoring edit configmap cluster-monitoring-config
----

. Add a `remoteWrite:` section under `data/config.yaml/prometheusK8s`.

. Add an endpoint URL and authentication credentials in this section:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com" <1>
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials> <2>
----
+
<1> The URL of the remote write endpoint.
<2> The authentication method and credentials for the endpoint.
Currently supported authentication methods are AWS Signature Version 4, authentication using HTTP in an `Authorization` request header, Basic authentication, OAuth 2.0, and TLS client.
See _Supported remote write authentication settings_ for sample configurations of supported authentication methods.

. Add write relabel configuration values after the authentication credentials:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        <endpoint_authentication_credentials>
        <your_write_relabel_configs> <1>
----
<1> The write relabel configuration settings.
+
For `<your_write_relabel_configs>` substitute a list of write relabel configurations for metrics that you want to send to the remote endpoint.
+
The following sample shows how to forward a single metric called `my_metric`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    prometheusK8s:
      remoteWrite:
      - url: "https://remote-write-endpoint.example.com"
        writeRelabelConfigs:
        - sourceLabels: [__name__]
          regex: 'my_metric'
          action: keep

----
+
See the link:https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_config[Prometheus relabel_config documentation] for information about write relabel configuration options.

. Save the file to apply the changes to the `ConfigMap` object.
The pods affected by the new configuration restart automatically.
+
[WARNING]
====
Saving changes to a monitoring `ConfigMap` object might redeploy the pods and other resources in the related project. Saving changes might also restart the running monitoring processes in that project.
