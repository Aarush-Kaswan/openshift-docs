= About API token expiration

API tokens expire one year from the creation date. {product-title-short} alerts you in the web interface and by sending log messages to Central when a token will expire in less than one week. The log message process runs once an hour. Once a day, the process lists the tokens that are expiring and creates a log message for each one. Log messages are issued once a day and appear in Central logs.

Logs have the format as shown in the following example:

[source,text]
----
Warn: API Token [token name] (ID [token ID]) will expire in less than X days.
----

You can change the default settings for the log message process by configuring the environment variables shown in the following table:
