= Restarting a build

To restart a build, you can add or edit the `sonataflow.org/restartBuild: true` annotation in the `SonataFlowBuild` instance. Restarting a build is necessary if there is a problem with your workflow or the initial build revision.
 
.Prerequisites

* You have an {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} installed on your cluster.
* You have access to an {ServerlessLogicProductName} project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in {ocp-product-title}.
* You have installed the OpenShift CLI `(oc)`.

.Procedure

. Check if the `SonataFlowBuild` instance exists by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get sonataflowbuild <name> -n <namespace>
----

. Edit the `SonataFlowBuild` instance by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit sonataflowbuild/<name> -n <namespace>
----

+
Replace `<name>` with the name of your `SonataFlowBuild` instance and `<namespace>` with the namespace where your workflow is deployed.

. Add the `sonataflow.org/restartBuild: true` annotation to restart the build.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowBuild
metadata:
  name: <name>
  annotations:
    sonataflow.org/restartBuild: true
----
+
This action triggers the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} to start a new build of the workflow.

. To monitor the build process, check the build logs by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc logs buildconfig/<name> -n <namespace>
----
+
Replace `<name>` with the name of your `SonataFlowBuild` instance and `<namespace>` with the namespace where your workflow is deployed.
