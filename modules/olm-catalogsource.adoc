[id="olm-catalogsource_{context}"]
= Catalog source

A _catalog source_ represents a store of metadata, typically by referencing an _index image_ stored in a container registry. Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) queries catalog sources to discover and install Operators and their dependencies. The OperatorHub in the {product-title} web console also displays the Operators provided by catalog sources.

[TIP]
====
Cluster administrators can view the full list of Operators provided by an enabled catalog source on a cluster by using the *Administration* -> *Cluster Settings* -> *Configuration* -> *OperatorHub* page in the web console.
====

The `spec` of a `CatalogSource` object indicates how to construct a pod or how to communicate with a service that serves the Operator Registry gRPC API.

----
<1> Name for the `CatalogSource` object. This value is also used as part of the name for the related pod that is created in the requested namespace.
<2> Namespace to create the catalog in. To make the catalog available cluster-wide in all namespaces, set this value to `{global_ns}`. The default Red Hat-provided catalog sources also use the `{global_ns}` namespace. Otherwise, set the value to a specific namespace to make the Operator only available in that namespace.
<3> Display name for the catalog in the web console and CLI.
<4> Index image for the catalog.
<5> Weight for the catalog source. OLM uses the weight for prioritization during dependency resolution. A higher weight indicates the catalog is preferred over lower-weighted catalogs.
<6> Source types include the following:
+
--
* `grpc` with an `image` reference: OLM pulls the image and runs the pod, which is expected to serve a compliant API.
* `grpc` with an `address` field: OLM attempts to contact the gRPC API at the given address. This should not be used in most cases.
* `configmap`: OLM parses config map data and runs a pod that can serve the gRPC API over it.
--
<7> Automatically check for new versions at a given interval to stay up-to-date.
<8> Last observed state of the catalog connection. For example:
+
--
* `READY`: A connection is successfully established.
* `CONNECTING`: A connection is attempting to establish.
* `TRANSIENT_FAILURE`: A temporary problem has occurred while attempting to establish a connection, such as a timeout. The state will eventually switch back to `CONNECTING` and try again.
--
+
See link:https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_connectivity-semantics-and-api.html[States of Connectivity] in the gRPC documentation for more details.
<9> Latest time the container registry storing the catalog image was polled to ensure the image is up-to-date.
<10> Status information for the catalog's Operator Registry service.

Referencing the `name` of a `CatalogSource` object in a subscription instructs OLM where to search to find a requested Operator:
