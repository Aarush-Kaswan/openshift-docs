= Changing resource requirements

You can specify resource requirements for the internal builder pods, by creating or editing a `SonataFlowPlatform` resource in the workflow namespace.

.Example `SonataFlowPlatform` resource
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowPlatform
metadata:
  name: sonataflow-platform
spec:
  build:
    template:
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
          cpu: "500m"
----

[NOTE]
====
Only one `SonataFlowPlatform` resource is allowed per namespace. Fetch and edit the resource that the {ServerlessLogicOperatorName} created for you instead of trying to create another resource.
====

You can fine-tune the resource requirements for a particular workflow. Each workflow instance has a `SonataFlowBuild` instance created with the same name as the workflow. You can edit the `SonataFlowBuild` custom resource (CR) and specify the parameters as follows:

.Example of `SonataFlowBuild` CR
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlowBuild
metadata:
  name: my-workflow
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "64Mi"
      cpu: "250m"
    limits:
      memory: "128Mi"
      cpu: "500m"

These parameters apply only to new build instances.
