= Setting the expiration of the administration events

By specifying the number of days, you can control when the administration events expire. This is important for managing your events and ensuring that you retain the information for the desired duration.

[NOTE]
====
By default, administration events are retained for 4 days. The retention period for these events is determined by the time of the last occurrence and not by the time of creation. This means that an event expires and is deleted only if the time of the last occurrence exceeds the specified retention period.
