= Restarting or canceling a pipeline run using {pac}

You can restart or cancel a pipeline run with no events, such as sending a new commit to your branch or raising a pull request. To restart all pipeline runs, use the *Re-run all checks* feature in the GitHub App. 

To restart all or specific pipeline runs, use the following comments:

* The `/test` and `/retest` comment restarts all pipeline runs.

* The `/test <pipeline_run_name>` and `/retest <pipeline_run_name>` comment restarts a specific pipeline run.

To cancel all or specific pipeline runs, use the following comments:

* The `/cancel` comment cancels all pipeline runs.

* The `/cancel <pipeline_run_name>` comment cancels a specific pipeline run.

The results of the comments are visible under the *Checks* tab of the GitHub App.

.Procedure

* If you target a pull request and you use the GitHub App, go to the *Checks* tab and click *Re-run all checks*.

* If you target a pull or merge request, use the comments inside your pull request:

* If you target a push request, include the comments within your commit messages.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is supported for the GitHub provider only.
====

.. Go to your GitHub repository.

.. Click the *Commits* section.

.. Click the commit where you want to restart a pipeline run.

.. Click on the line number where you want to add a comment.

/retest <pipeline_run_name>

[NOTE]
====
If you run a command on a commit that exists in multiple branches within a push request, the branch with the latest commit is used.

This results in two situations:

* If you run a command on a commit without any argument, such as `/test`, the test is automatically performed on the `main` branch.

* If you include a branch specification, such as `/test branch:user-branch`, the test is performed on the commit where the comment is located with the context of the `user-branch` branch.
