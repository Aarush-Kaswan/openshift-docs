= Analysis and detection

[role="_abstract"]
When you use {product-title-short} with {ocp}, {product-title-short} creates two coordinating containers for analysis and detection, the Compliance container and the Node-inventory container.
The Compliance container was already a part of earlier {product-title-short} versions.
However, the Node-inventory container is new with {product-title-short} 4.0 and works only with {ocp} cluster nodes.

Upon start-up, the Compliance and Node-inventory containers begin the first inventory scan of Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) software components within five minutes. Next, the Node-inventory container scans the node's file system to identify installed RPM packages and report on RHCOS software components. Afterward, inventory scanning occurs at periodic intervals, typically every four hours. You can customize the default interval by configuring the ROX_NODE_SCANNING_INTERVAL environment variable for the Compliance container.
