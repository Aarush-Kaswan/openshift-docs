= About Lightspeed conversations

{ols-long} is designed to answer questions about {ocp-short-name}, {k8s}, and additional {ocp-short-name} components, such as {ocp-virt}, {ocp-pipe}, and {ossm}. 

{ols-long} will not answer questions that are unrelated to the targeted topics. In some cases, you may need to rephrase an ambiguously worded question because {ols-long} could not correctly interpret what you asked. Conversation history helps provide context that {ols-long} references when generating answers. Using specific language helps increase the success of responses. For example, instead of asking "How do I start a virtual machine?" try asking "How do I start a virtual machine in {ocp-virt}?"

Conversation history does not persist if you reload the console page. Reloading the console page performs the same action as clicking the *New Chat* button. Conversation history is also erased if {ols-long} is restarted.
