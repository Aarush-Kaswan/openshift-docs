= EUS-to-EUS update

The following procedure pauses all non-master machine config pools and performs updates from {product-title} 4.8 to 4.9 to 4.10, then unpauses the previously paused machine config pools.
Following this procedure reduces the total update duration and the number of times worker nodes are restarted.

.Prerequisites

* Review the release notes for {product-title} 4.9 and 4.10.
* Review the release notes and product lifecycles for any layered products and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) Operators. Some may require updates either before or during an EUS-to-EUS update.
