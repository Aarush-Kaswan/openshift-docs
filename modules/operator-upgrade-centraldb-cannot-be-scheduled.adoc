= Central DB cannot be scheduled

[role="_abstract"]
Follow the instructions here to troubleshoot a failing Central DB pod during an upgrade:

. Check the status of the `central-db` pod:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <namespace> get pod -l app=central-db <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.
. If the status of the pod is `Pending`, use the describe command to get more details:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <namespace> describe po/<central-db-pod-name> <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.
. You might see the `FailedScheduling` warning message:
+
[source,terminal]
----
Type     Reason            Age   From               Message
----     ------            ----  ----               -------
Warning  FailedScheduling  54s   default-scheduler  0/7 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient memory, 3 node(s) had untolerated taint {node-role.kubernetes.io/master: }, 4 Insufficient cpu. preemption: 0/7 nodes are available: 3 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling, 4 No preemption victims found for incoming pod.
----
. This warning message suggests that the scheduled node had insufficient memory to accommodate the pod's resource requirements. If you have a small environment, consider increasing resources on the nodes or adding a larger node that can support the database.
+
Otherwise, consider decreasing the resource requirements for the `central-db` pod in the custom resource under `central` -> `db` -> `resources`. However, running central with fewer resources than the recommended minimum might lead to degraded performance for {product-title-short}.
