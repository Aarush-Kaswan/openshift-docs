= Disabling automatic creation of routes

By default, the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource automatically synchronizes the Gateway resources with OpenShift routes. Disabling the automatic route creation allows you more flexibility to control routes if you have a special case or prefer to control routes manually.

== Disabling automatic route creation for specific cases

If you want to disable the automatic management of OpenShift routes for a specific Istio Gateway, you must add the annotation `maistra.io/manageRoute: false` to the Gateway metadata definition. {SMProductName} will ignore Istio Gateways with this annotation, while keeping the automatic management of the other Istio Gateways.

[id="disabling-automatic-route-creation-all-cases_{context}"]
== Disabling automatic route creation for all cases

You can disable the automatic management of OpenShift routes for all Gateways in your mesh.

Disable integration between Istio Gateways and OpenShift Routes by setting the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` field `gateways.openshiftRoute.enabled` to `false`. For example, see the following resource snippet.

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  gateways:
    openshiftRoute:
      enabled: false
