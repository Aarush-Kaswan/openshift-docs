Once the {ols-long} Operator is installed, deploying the {ols-long} service involves two steps. First, you create a secret using your Large Language Model (LLM) provider credentials. Then, you create the `OLSConfig` custom resource (CR). The CR contains information that informs the Operator how to deploy the {ols-long} service.

[NOTE]
====
The instructions assume that you are installing {ols-long} using the `kubeadmin` user account. If you are using a regular user account with `cluster-admin` privileges, read the section of the documentation that discusses RBAC.
