= Configuring your function project using the func.yaml file
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]
:context: serverless-functions-yaml

toc::[]

The `func.yaml` file contains the configuration for your function project. Values specified in `func.yaml` are used when you execute a `kn func` command. For example, when you run the `kn func build` command, the value in the `build` field is used. In some cases, you can override these values with command line flags or environment variables.

[id="serverless-functions-annotations"]
== Adding annotations to functions

You can add Kubernetes annotations to a deployed Serverless function. Annotations enable you to attach arbitrary metadata to a function, for example, a note about the function's purpose. Annotations are added to the `annotations` section of the `func.yaml` configuration file.

There are two limitations of the function annotation feature:

* After a function annotation propagates to the corresponding Knative service on the cluster, it cannot be removed from the service by deleting it from the `func.yaml` file. You must remove the annotation from the Knative service by modifying the YAML file of the service directly, or by using the {ocp-product-title} web console.

* You cannot set annotations that are set by Knative, for example, the `autoscaling` annotations.
