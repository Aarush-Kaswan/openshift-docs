The Data Index service is a dedicated supporting service that stores the data related to the workflow instances and their associated jobs. This service provides a GraphQL endpoint allowing users to query that data.

The Data Index service processes data received through events, which can originate from any workflow or directly from the Job service.

Data Index supports Apache Kafka or Knative Eventing to consume CloudEvents messages from workflows. It indexes and stores this event data in a database, making it accessible through GraphQL. These events provide detailed information about the workflow execution. The Data Index service is central to {ServerlessLogicProductName} search, insights, and management capabilities.

The key features of the Data Index service are as follows:

* A flexible data structure
* A distributable, cloud-ready format
* Message-based communication with workflows via Apache Kafka, Knative, and CloudEvents
* A powerful GraphQL-based querying API

[NOTE]
====
When you are using the {ServerlessOperatorName} to deploy workflows, you do not need to manually install or configure the Data Index service. The Operator automatically manages all the necessary configurations for each workflow to connect with it.
