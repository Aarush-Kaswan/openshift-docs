The Job service schedules and executes tasks in a cloud environment. Independent services implement these tasks, which can be initiated through any of the supported interaction modes, including HTTP calls or Knative Events delivery.

In {ServerlessLogicProductName}, the Job service is responsible for controlling the execution of the time-triggered actions. Therefore, all the time-based states that you can use in a workflow, are handled by the interaction between the workflow and the Job service.

For example, every time the workflow execution reaches a state with a configured timeout, a corresponding job is created in the Job service, and when the timeout is met, an HTTP callback is executed to notify the workflow.

The main goal of the Job service is to manage active jobs, such as scheduled jobs that need to be executed. When a job reaches its final state, the Job service removes it. To retain jobs information in a permanent repository, the Job service produces status change events that can be recorded by an external service, such as the Data Index Service.

[NOTE]
====
You do not need to manually install or configure the Job service if you are using the {ServerlessOperatorName} to deploy workflows. The Operator handles these tasks automatically and manages all necessary configurations for each workflow to connect with it.
