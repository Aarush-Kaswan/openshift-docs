The link:https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html[_OpenAPI Specification_] (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface for HTTP APIs. You can understand a service's capabilities without access to the source code, additional documentation, or network traffic inspection. When you define a service by using the OpenAPI, you can understand and interact with it using minimal implementation logic. Just as interface descriptions simplify lower-level programming, the _OpenAPI Specification_ eliminates guesswork in calling a service.
