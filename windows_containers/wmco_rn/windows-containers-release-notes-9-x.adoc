== About {productwinc}

Windows Container Support for {product-title} enables running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. Running Windows workloads is possible by using the Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator (WMCO) to install and manage Windows nodes. With Windows nodes available, you can run Windows container workloads in {product-title}.

These release notes track the development of the WMCO, which provides all Windows container workload capabilities in {product-title}.

== Release notes for Red Hat Windows Machine Config Operator 9.0.3

This release of the WMCO provides a security update and bug fixes for running Windows compute nodes in an {product-title} cluster. The components of the WMCO 9.0.3 were released in link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:6460[RHSA-2024:6460].

=== Bug fixes

* Previously, after rotating the `kube-apiserver-to-kubelet-client-ca` certificate, the contents of the `kubetl-ca.crt` file on Windows nodes was not populated correctly. With this fix, after certificate rotation, the `kubetl-ca.crt` file contains the correct certificates. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-35572[*OCPBUGS-35572*])

* Previously, if reverse DNS lookup failed due to an error, such as the reverse DNS lookup services being unavailable, the WMCO would not fall back to using the VM hostname to determine if a certificate signing requests (CSR) should be approved. As a consequence, Bring-Your-Own-Host (BYOH) Windows nodes configured with an IP address would not become available. With this fix, BYOH nodes are properly added if reverse DNS is not available. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38595[*OCPBUGS-38595*])

* Previously, if there were multiple service account token secrets in the WMCO namespace, the scaling of Windows nodes would fail. With this fix, the WMCO uses only the secret it creates, ignoring any other service account token secrets in the WMCO namespace. As a result, Windows nodes scale properly. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-38592[*OCPBUGS-38592*])
