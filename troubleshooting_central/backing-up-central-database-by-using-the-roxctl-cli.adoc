Central stores information about the following:

* Activity observed in your clusters
* Information retrieved from integrated image registries or Scanners
* {rh-rhacs-first} configuration

Backing up the Central database is critical to ensure data integrity and system reliability. Regular backups of the database, which contain the necessary configurations, resources, events, and certificates, protect against database failures, corruption, and accidental data loss.

You can use the `roxctl` CLI to back up and restore the Central database by using the `backup` command. This command requires an API token or your administrator password.
