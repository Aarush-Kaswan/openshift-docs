Currently, {olmv1} supports the installation of Operators and extensions that meet the following criteria:

* The Operator or extension must use the `AllNamespaces` install mode.
* The Operator or extension must not use webhooks.

Operators or extensions that use webhooks or that target a single or specified set of namespaces cannot be installed.
