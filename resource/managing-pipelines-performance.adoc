If your {pipelines-shortname} installation runs a large number of tasks at the same time, its performance might degrade. You might experience slowdowns and failed pipeline runs.

For reference, in Red Hat tests, on a three-node {OCP} cluster running on Amazon Web Services (AWS) `m6a.2xlarge` nodes, up to 60 simple test pipelines ran concurrently without significant failures or delays. If more pipelines ran concurrently, the number of failed pipeline runs, the average duration of a pipeline run, the pod creation latency, the work queue depth, and the number of pending pods increased. This testing was performed on {pipelines-title} version 1.13; no statistically significant difference was observed from version 1.12.

[NOTE]
====
These results depend on the test configuration. Performance results with your configuration can be different.
