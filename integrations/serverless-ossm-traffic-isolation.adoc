:FeatureName: Using {SMProductShortName} to isolate network traffic with {ServerlessProductName}
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

{SMProductShortName} can be used to isolate network traffic between tenants on a shared {product-title} cluster using Service Mesh `AuthorizationPolicy` resources. {ServerlessProductShortName} can also leverage this, using several {SMProductShortName} resources. A tenant is a group of one or multiple projects that can access each other over the network on a shared cluster.

== Prerequisites

* You have access to an {product-title} account with cluster administrator access.
