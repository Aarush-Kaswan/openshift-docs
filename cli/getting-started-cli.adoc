This topic describes `roxctl` syntax, operations, and provides some common examples.

== Installing the roxctl CLI

You can install the `roxctl` CLI by downloading the binary or you can run the `roxctl` CLI from a container image.

=== Installing the roxctl CLI by downloading the binary

You can install the `roxctl` CLI to interact with {product-title} from a
command-line interface. You can install `roxctl` on Linux, Windows, or macOS.

== Authenticating by using the `roxctl` CLI

For authentication, you can use an API token, your administrator password, or `roxctl login` command.

* Use an API token in a production environment with continuous integration (CI). Each token is assigned specific access permissions, providing control over the actions it can perform. In addition, API tokens do not require interactive processes, such as browser-based logins, making them ideal for automated processes. These tokens have a time-to-live (TTL) of 1 year, providing a longer validity period for seamless integration and operational efficiency.

* Use your administrator password only for testing purposes and not in the production environment.

* Use the `roxctl login` command only for interactive use.
