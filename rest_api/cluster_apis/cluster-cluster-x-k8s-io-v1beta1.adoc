| MachineHealthCheck allows to enable, disable and override
the MachineHealthCheck configuration in the ClusterClass for this control plane.

| `metadata`
| `object`
| Metadata is the metadata applied to the ControlPlane and the Machines of the ControlPlane

is applied only to the ControlPlane.
At runtime this metadata is merged with the corresponding metadata from the ClusterClass.

| `nodeDeletionTimeout`

hosts after the Machine is marked for deletion. A duration of 0 will retry deletion indefinitely.
Defaults to 10 seconds.

provided by an infrastructure provider.


This field is completely optional, when filled, the MachineHealthCheck controller
creates a new object from the template referenced and hands off remediation of the machine to
a controller that lives outside of Cluster API.

whether a node is considered unhealthy. The conditions are combined in a
logical OR, i.e. if any of the conditions is met, the node is unhealthy.

specified as a duration.  When the named condition has been in the given

is within the range of "UnhealthyRange". Takes precedence over MaxUnhealthy.
Eg. "[3-5]" - This means that remediation will be allowed only when:
(a) there are at least 3 unhealthy machines (and)

i.e. it is not possible to have no type field.

| Property | Type | Description

| `annotations`

queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.
More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations

(scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers
and services.

new ones.

| Property | Type | Description

| `rollingUpdate`
| `object`

Type::

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `deletePolicy`
| `string`
| DeletePolicy defines the policy used by the MachineDeployment to identify nodes to delete when downscaling.
Valid values are "Random, "Newest", "Oldest"
When no value is supplied, the default DeletePolicy of MachineSet is used

| `maxSurge`
| `integer-or-string`
| The maximum number of machines that can be scheduled above the
desired number of machines.
Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of
desired machines (ex: 10%).
This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
Defaults to 1.
Example: when this is set to 30%, the new MachineSet can be scaled
up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total
number of old and new machines do not exceed 130% of desired
machines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet can
be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines running
at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.

| `maxUnavailable`
| `integer-or-string`
| The maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the update.
Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired
machines (ex: 10%).
Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
Defaults to 0.
Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaled
down to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling update
starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled
down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring
that the total number of machines available at all times
during the update is at least 70% of desired machines.

hard-coded schema for apiextensionsv1.JSON which cannot be produced by another type via controller-tools,
i.e. it is not possible to have no type field.

| `nodeVolumeDetachTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeVolumeDetachTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on waiting for all volumes
to be detached. The default value is 0, meaning that the volumes can be detached without any time limitations.
