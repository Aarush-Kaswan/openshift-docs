== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| MachineDeploymentSpec defines the desired state of MachineDeployment.

| `status`
| `object`
| MachineDeploymentStatus defines the observed state of MachineDeployment.

|===
=== .spec
Description::
+
--
MachineDeploymentSpec defines the desired state of MachineDeployment.
--

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `clusterName`
  - `selector`
  - `template`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `clusterName`
| `string`
| ClusterName is the name of the Cluster this object belongs to.

| `minReadySeconds`
| `integer`
| MinReadySeconds is the minimum number of seconds for which a Node for a newly created machine should be ready before considering the replica available.
Defaults to 0 (machine will be considered available as soon as the Node is ready)

| `paused`
| `boolean`
| Indicates that the deployment is paused.

| `progressDeadlineSeconds`
| `integer`
| The maximum time in seconds for a deployment to make progress before it
is considered to be failed. The deployment controller will continue to
process failed deployments and a condition with a ProgressDeadlineExceeded
reason will be surfaced in the deployment status. Note that progress will
not be estimated during the time a deployment is paused. Defaults to 600s.

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| Number of desired machines.
This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified.


Defaults to:
* if the Kubernetes autoscaler min size and max size annotations are set:
  - if it's a new MachineDeployment, use min size
  - if the replicas field of the old MachineDeployment is < min size, use min size
  - if the replicas field of the old MachineDeployment is > max size, use max size
  - if the replicas field of the old MachineDeployment is in the (min size, max size) range, keep the value from the oldMD
* otherwise use 1
Note: Defaulting will be run whenever the replicas field is not set:
* A new MachineDeployment is created with replicas not set.
* On an existing MachineDeployment the replicas field was first set and is now unset.
Those cases are especially relevant for the following Kubernetes autoscaler use cases:
* A new MachineDeployment is created and replicas should be managed by the autoscaler
* An existing MachineDeployment which initially wasn't controlled by the autoscaler
  should be later controlled by the autoscaler

| `revisionHistoryLimit`
| `integer`
| The number of old MachineSets to retain to allow rollback.
This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified.
Defaults to 1.

| `rolloutAfter`
| `string`
| RolloutAfter is a field to indicate a rollout should be performed
after the specified time even if no changes have been made to the
MachineDeployment.
Example: In the YAML the time can be specified in the RFC3339 format.
To specify the rolloutAfter target as March 9, 2023, at 9 am UTC
use "2023-03-09T09:00:00Z".

| `selector`
| `object`
| Label selector for machines. Existing MachineSets whose machines are
selected by this will be the ones affected by this deployment.
It must match the machine template's labels.

| `strategy`
| `object`
| The deployment strategy to use to replace existing machines with
new ones.

| `template`
| `object`
| Template describes the machines that will be created.

| `matchExpressions[]`
| `object`
| A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that
relates the key and values.

| `matchLabels`
| `object (string)`
| matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

|===
=== .spec.selector.matchExpressions
Description::
+
--
matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.
--

Type::

| `operator`
| `string`
| operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values.
Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

| `values`
| `array (string)`
| values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn,
the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist,
the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic
merge patch.

| Property | Type | Description

| `rollingUpdate`
| `object`
| Rolling update config params. Present only if
MachineDeploymentStrategyType = RollingUpdate.

| `type`
| `string`
| Type of deployment. Allowed values are RollingUpdate and OnDelete.
The default is RollingUpdate.

Description::
+
--
Rolling update config params. Present only if
MachineDeploymentStrategyType = RollingUpdate.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `deletePolicy`
| `string`
| DeletePolicy defines the policy used by the MachineDeployment to identify nodes to delete when downscaling.
Valid values are "Random, "Newest", "Oldest"
When no value is supplied, the default DeletePolicy of MachineSet is used

| `maxSurge`
| `integer-or-string`
| The maximum number of machines that can be scheduled above the
desired number of machines.
Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of
desired machines (ex: 10%).
This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0.
Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up.
Defaults to 1.
Example: when this is set to 30%, the new MachineSet can be scaled
up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total
number of old and new machines do not exceed 130% of desired
machines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet can
be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines running
at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.

| `maxUnavailable`
| `integer-or-string`
| The maximum number of machines that can be unavailable during the update.
Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired
machines (ex: 10%).
Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding down.
This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0.
Defaults to 0.
Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaled
down to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling update
starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled
down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring
that the total number of machines available at all times
during the update is at least 70% of desired machines.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `bootstrap`
  - `clusterName`
  - `infrastructureRef`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `bootstrap`
| `object`
| Bootstrap is a reference to a local struct which encapsulates
fields to configure the Machine’s bootstrapping mechanism.

| `clusterName`
| `string`
| ClusterName is the name of the Cluster this object belongs to.

| `failureDomain`
| `string`
| FailureDomain is the failure domain the machine will be created in.
Must match a key in the FailureDomains map stored on the cluster object.

| `infrastructureRef`
| `object`
| InfrastructureRef is a required reference to a custom resource
offered by an infrastructure provider.

| `nodeDeletionTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeDeletionTimeout defines how long the controller will attempt to delete the Node that the Machine
hosts after the Machine is marked for deletion. A duration of 0 will retry deletion indefinitely.
Defaults to 10 seconds.

| `nodeDrainTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeDrainTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on draining a node.
The default value is 0, meaning that the node can be drained without any time limitations.
NOTE: NodeDrainTimeout is different from `kubectl drain --timeout`

| `nodeVolumeDetachTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeVolumeDetachTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on waiting for all volumes
to be detached. The default value is 0, meaning that the volumes can be detached without any time limitations.

| `providerID`
| `string`
| ProviderID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.
This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

| `version`
| `string`
| Version defines the desired Kubernetes version.
This field is meant to be optionally used by bootstrap providers.

|===
=== .spec.template.spec.bootstrap
Description::
+
--
Bootstrap is a reference to a local struct which encapsulates
fields to configure the Machine’s bootstrapping mechanism.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `configRef`
| `object`
| ConfigRef is a reference to a bootstrap provider-specific resource
that holds configuration details. The reference is optional to
allow users/operators to specify Bootstrap.DataSecretName without
the need of a controller.

| `dataSecretName`
| `string`
| DataSecretName is the name of the secret that stores the bootstrap data script.
If nil, the Machine should remain in the Pending state.

|===
=== .spec.template.spec.bootstrap.configRef
Description::

| Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| Type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
