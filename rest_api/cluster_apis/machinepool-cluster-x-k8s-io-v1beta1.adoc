Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `bootstrap`
  - `clusterName`
  - `infrastructureRef`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `bootstrap`
| `object`
| Bootstrap is a reference to a local struct which encapsulates
fields to configure the Machine’s bootstrapping mechanism.

| `clusterName`
| `string`
| ClusterName is the name of the Cluster this object belongs to.

| `failureDomain`
| `string`
| FailureDomain is the failure domain the machine will be created in.
Must match a key in the FailureDomains map stored on the cluster object.

| `infrastructureRef`
| `object`
| InfrastructureRef is a required reference to a custom resource
offered by an infrastructure provider.

| `nodeDeletionTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeDeletionTimeout defines how long the controller will attempt to delete the Node that the Machine
hosts after the Machine is marked for deletion. A duration of 0 will retry deletion indefinitely.
Defaults to 10 seconds.

| `nodeDrainTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeDrainTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on draining a node.
The default value is 0, meaning that the node can be drained without any time limitations.
NOTE: NodeDrainTimeout is different from `kubectl drain --timeout`

| `nodeVolumeDetachTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeVolumeDetachTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on waiting for all volumes
to be detached. The default value is 0, meaning that the volumes can be detached without any time limitations.

| `providerID`
| `string`
| ProviderID is the identification ID of the machine provided by the provider.
This field must match the provider ID as seen on the node object corresponding to this machine.
This field is required by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster autoscaler
with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler compares machines to nodes to find out
machines at provider which could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a
generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required by autoscaler to be
able to have a provider view of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver
and then a comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked for delete.
This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by higher level entities like autoscaler that will
be interfacing with cluster-api as generic provider.

| `version`
| `string`
| Version defines the desired Kubernetes version.
This field is meant to be optionally used by bootstrap providers.

|===
=== .spec.template.spec.bootstrap
Description::
+
--
Bootstrap is a reference to a local struct which encapsulates
fields to configure the Machine’s bootstrapping mechanism.
--

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `configRef`
| `object`
| ConfigRef is a reference to a bootstrap provider-specific resource
that holds configuration details. The reference is optional to
allow users/operators to specify Bootstrap.DataSecretName without
the need of a controller.

| `dataSecretName`
| `string`
| DataSecretName is the name of the secret that stores the bootstrap data script.
If nil, the Machine should remain in the Pending state.

|===
=== .spec.template.spec.bootstrap.configRef
Description::
+
--
ConfigRef is a reference to a bootstrap provider-specific resource
that holds configuration details. The reference is optional to
allow users/operators to specify Bootstrap.DataSecretName without
the need of a controller.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| API version of the referent.

| `fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
"spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
referencing a part of an object.
TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
 2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
    restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
    Those cannot be well described when embedded.
 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
 4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
    during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
    and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
    will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.


Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| ObservedGeneration is the latest generation observed by the controller.

| `phase`
| `string`
| Phase represents the current phase of cluster actuation.
E.g. Pending, Running, Terminating, Failed etc.

| `readyReplicas`
| `integer`
| The number of ready replicas for this MachinePool. A machine is considered ready when the node has been created and is "Ready".

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| Replicas is the most recently observed number of replicas.

| `unavailableReplicas`
| `integer`
| Total number of unavailable machine instances targeted by this machine pool.
This is the total number of machine instances that are still required for
the machine pool to have 100% available capacity. They may either
be machine instances that are running but not yet available or machine instances
that still have not been created.

Description::
+
--
Condition defines an observation of a Cluster API resource operational state.
--

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `lastTransitionTime`
  - `status`
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| Last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
the API field changed is acceptable.

| `message`
| `string`
| A human readable message indicating details about the transition.
This field may be empty.

| `reason`
| `string`
| The reason for the condition's last transition in CamelCase.
The specific API may choose whether or not this field is considered a guaranteed API.
This field may not be empty.

| `severity`
| `string`
| Severity provides an explicit classification of Reason code, so the users or machines can immediately
understand the current situation and act accordingly.
The Severity field MUST be set only when Status=False.

| `status`
| `string`
| Status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| Type of condition in CamelCase or in foo.example.com/CamelCase.
Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
