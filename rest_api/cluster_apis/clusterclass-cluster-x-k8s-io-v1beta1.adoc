This field is supported if and only if the ControlPlane provider template
referenced above is Machine based and supports setting replicas.

| `machineInfrastructure`
| `object`
| MachineInfrastructure defines the metadata and infrastructure information
for control plane machines.


This field is supported if and only if the control plane provider template
referenced above is Machine based and supports setting replicas.

| `metadata`
| `object`
| Metadata is the metadata applied to the ControlPlane and the Machines of the ControlPlane
if the ControlPlaneTemplate referenced is machine based. If not, it is applied only to the
ControlPlane.
At runtime this metadata is merged with the corresponding metadata from the topology.


This field is supported if and only if the control plane provider template
referenced is Machine based.

| `namingStrategy`
| `object`
| NamingStrategy allows changing the naming pattern used when creating the control plane provider object.

| `nodeDeletionTimeout`

| NodeDeletionTimeout defines how long the controller will attempt to delete the Node that the Machine
hosts after the Machine is marked for deletion. A duration of 0 will retry deletion indefinitely.
Defaults to 10 seconds.
NOTE: This value can be overridden while defining a Cluster.Topology.

| `nodeDrainTimeout`

| NodeDrainTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on draining a node.
The default value is 0, meaning that the node can be drained without any time limitations.
NOTE: NodeDrainTimeout is different from `kubectl drain --timeout`
NOTE: This value can be overridden while defining a Cluster.Topology.

| `nodeVolumeDetachTimeout`
| `string`
| NodeVolumeDetachTimeout is the total amount of time that the controller will spend on waiting for all volumes
to be detached. The default value is 0, meaning that the volumes can be detached without any time limitations.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `maxUnhealthy`
| `integer-or-string`
| Any further remediation is only allowed if at most "MaxUnhealthy" machines selected by
"selector" are not healthy.

failed and will be remediated.
If you wish to disable this feature, set the value explicitly to 0.

| `remediationTemplate`
| `object`
| RemediationTemplate is a reference to a remediation template
provided by an infrastructure provider.


This field is completely optional, when filled, the MachineHealthCheck controller
creates a new object from the template referenced and hands off remediation of the machine to
a controller that lives outside of Cluster API.

| `unhealthyConditions`
| `array`
| UnhealthyConditions contains a list of the conditions that determine
whether a node is considered unhealthy. The conditions are combined in a
logical OR, i.e. if any of the conditions is met, the node is unhealthy.

| `unhealthyConditions[]`
| `object`
| UnhealthyCondition represents a Node condition type and value with a timeout
specified as a duration.  When the named condition has been in the given
status for at least the timeout value, a node is considered unhealthy.

| `unhealthyRange`
| `string`
| Any further remediation is only allowed if the number of machines selected by "selector" as not healthy
is within the range of "UnhealthyRange". Takes precedence over MaxUnhealthy.
Eg. "[3-5]" - This means that remediation will be allowed only when:
(a) there are at least 3 unhealthy machines (and)
(b) there are at most 5 unhealthy machines

| Property | Type | Description

| `fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
"spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of

Defaults to 1.
Example: when this is set to 30%, the new MachineSet can be scaled
up immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total
number of old and new machines do not exceed 130% of desired
machines. Once old machines have been killed, new MachineSet can
be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of machines running
at any time during the update is at most 130% of desired machines.

Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired

Defaults to 0.
Example: when this is set to 30%, the old MachineSet can be scaled
down to 70% of desired machines immediately when the rolling update
starts. Once new machines are ready, old MachineSet can be scaled
down further, followed by scaling up the new MachineSet, ensuring
that the total number of machines available at all times

| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| API version of the referent.

| `fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
"spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
referencing a part of an object.
