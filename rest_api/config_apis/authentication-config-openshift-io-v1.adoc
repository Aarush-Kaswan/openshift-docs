[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#io.k8s.apimachinery.pkg.apis.meta.v1.ObjectMeta[`ObjectMeta`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration

| `status`
| `object`
| status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

| Property | Type | Description

| `oauthMetadata`
| `object`
| oauthMetadata contains the discovery endpoint data for OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata for an external OAuth server. This discovery document can be viewed from its served location: oc get --raw '/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server' For further details, see the IETF Draft: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-discovery-04#section-2 If oauthMetadata.name is non-empty, this value has precedence over any metadata reference stored in status. The key "oauthMetadata" is used to locate the data. If specified and the config map or expected key is not found, no metadata is served. If the specified metadata is not valid, no metadata is served. The namespace for this config map is openshift-config.

| `oidcProviders`
| `array`
| OIDCProviders are OIDC identity providers that can issue tokens for this cluster Can only be set if "Type" is set to "OIDC". 
 At most one provider can be configured.

| `oidcProviders[]`
| `object`
| 

| `serviceAccountIssuer`
| `string`
| serviceAccountIssuer is the identifier of the bound service account token issuer. The default is https://kubernetes.default.svc WARNING: Updating this field will not result in immediate invalidation of all bound tokens with the previous issuer value. Instead, the tokens issued by previous service account issuer will continue to be trusted for a time period chosen by the platform (currently set to 24h). This time period is subject to change over time. This allows internal components to transition to use new service account issuer without service distruption.

| `type`
| `string`
| type identifies the cluster managed, user facing authentication mode in use. Specifically, it manages the component that responds to login attempts. The default is IntegratedOAuth.

| `webhookTokenAuthenticator`
| `object`
| webhookTokenAuthenticator configures a remote token reviewer. These remote authentication webhooks can be used to verify bearer tokens via the tokenreviews.authentication.k8s.io REST API. This is required to honor bearer tokens that are provisioned by an external authentication service. 
 Can only be set if "Type" is set to "None".

| `webhookTokenAuthenticators`
| `array`
| webhookTokenAuthenticators is DEPRECATED, setting it has no effect.

| `webhookTokenAuthenticators[]`
| `object`
| deprecatedWebhookTokenAuthenticator holds the necessary configuration options for a remote token authenticator. It's the same as WebhookTokenAuthenticator but it's missing the 'required' validation on KubeConfig field.

| `fieldValidation`
| `string`
| fieldValidation instructs the server on how to handle objects in the request (POST/PUT/PATCH) containing unknown or duplicate fields. Valid values are: - Ignore: This will ignore any unknown fields that are silently dropped from the object, and will ignore all but the last duplicate field that the decoder encounters. This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.

This is the default behavior prior to v1.23. - Warn: This will send a warning via the standard warning response header for each unknown field that is dropped from the object, and for each duplicate field that is encountered. The request will still succeed if there are no other errors, and will only persist the last of any duplicate fields. This is the default in v1.23+ - Strict: This will fail the request with a BadRequest error if any unknown fields would be dropped from the object, or if any duplicate fields are present. The error returned from the server will contain all unknown and duplicate fields encountered.
