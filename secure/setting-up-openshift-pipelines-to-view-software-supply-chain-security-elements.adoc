toc::[]

[role="_abstract"]
Use the *Developer* or *Administrator* perspective to create or modify a pipeline and view key Software Supply Chain Security elements within a project.

Set up {pipelines-shortname} to view:

* **Project vulnerabilities**: Visual representation of identified vulnerabilities within a project.

* **Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs)**: Download or view detailed listing of PipelineRun components.

Additionally, PipelineRuns that meet {tekton-chains} requirement displays signed badges next to their names. This badge indicates that the pipeline run execution results are cryptographically signed and stored securely, for example within an OCI image.

The PipelineRun displays the signed badge next to its name only if you have configured {tekton-chains}. For information on configuring Tekton Chains, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/1.13/secure/using-tekton-chains-for-openshift-pipelines-supply-chain-security.html[Using Tekton Chains for OpenShift Pipelines supply chain security].
