:FeatureName: Compliance 2.0
include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

You can view the compliance results associated with your cluster by using the compliance 2.0 feature in the {rh-rhacs-first} portal. The feature collects compliance information gathered by the Compliance Operator into a single interface.

For more information about using the Compliance Operator, see xref:../../operating/manage-compliance-operator/compliance-operator-rhacs.adoc#compliance-operator-rhacs[Using the Compliance Operator with {product-title}].

[NOTE]
====
Currently, the compliance 2.0 feature and the Compliance Operator evaluate only infrastructure and platform compliance.
