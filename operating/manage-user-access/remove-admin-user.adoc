{rh-rhacs-first} creates an administrator account, `admin`, during the installation process which can be used to login via username and password.
The password is dynamically generated (unless specifically overridden) and unique to your ACS instance.

In production environments, it is highly recommended to create an authentication provider and remove the `admin` user.

include::modules/remove-admin-user.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

After applying the configuration changes, you will not be able to login as an `admin` user.

 [NOTE]
 ====
 It is possible to add the `admin` user again as a fallback by reverting the configuration changes.

 When enabling the `admin` user again, a new password will be generated.
