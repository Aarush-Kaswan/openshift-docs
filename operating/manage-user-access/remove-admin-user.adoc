{rh-rhacs-first} creates an administrator account, `admin`, during the installation process that can be used to log in with a user name and password.
The password is dynamically generated unless specifically overridden and is unique to your {product-title-short} instance.

In production environments, it is highly recommended to create an authentication provider and remove the `admin` user.

After applying the configuration changes, you cannot log in as an `admin` user.

[NOTE]
====
You can add the `admin` user again as a fallback by reverting the configuration changes. When enabling the `admin` user again, a new password is generated.
