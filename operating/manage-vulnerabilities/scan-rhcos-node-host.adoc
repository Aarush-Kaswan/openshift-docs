For {ocp}, Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) is the only supported operating system for control plane. Whereas, for node hosts, {ocp} supports both RHCOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
With {rh-rhacs-first}, you can scan RHCOS nodes for vulnerabilities and detect potential security threats.

{product-title-short} scans RHCOS RPMs installed on the node host, as part of the RHCOS installation, for any known vulnerabilities.

First, {product-title-short} analyzes and detects RHCOS components. Then it matches vulnerabilities for identified components by using Red Hat RHEL and OpenShift 4.X Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) v2 security data streams.

[NOTE]
====
* If you installed {product-title-short} by using the `roxctl` CLI, you must manually enable the RHCOS node scanning features. When you use Helm or Operator installation methods on {ocp}, this feature is enabled by default.
* Red Hat supports scanning for RHCOS nodes only if you are using {ocp} 4.10 and later.
