{product-title} (ROSA) web UI requires that you have specific permissions on your AWS account that create a trust relationship to provide the end-user experience at {cluster-manager-url} and for the `rosa` command line interface (CLI).

This trust relationship is achieved through the creation and association of the `ocm-role` AWS IAM role. This role has a trust policy with the AWS installer that links your Red Hat account to your AWS account. In addition, you also need a `user-role` AWS IAM role for each web UI user, which serves to identify these users. This `user-role` AWS IAM role has no permissions.

The AWS IAM roles required to use {cluster-manager} are:

1. `ocm-role`
2. `user-role`

Whether you manage your clusters using the `rosa` CLI or {cluster-manager} web UI, you must create the account-wide roles, known as `account-roles` in the `rosa` CLI, by using the `rosa` CLI. These account roles are necessary for your first cluster, and these roles can be used across multiple clusters. These required account roles are:

1. `Worker-Role` 
1. `Support-Role` 
1. `Installer-Role` 
1. `ControlPlane-Role`

[NOTE]
====
Role creation does not request your AWS access or secret keys. AWS Secure Token Service (STS) is used as the basis of this workflow. AWS STS uses temporary, limited-privilege credentials to provide authentication.

For more information about creating these roles, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-sts-account-wide-roles-and-policies[Account-wide IAM role and policy reference].

Cluster-specific Operator roles, known as `operator-roles` in the `rosa` CLI, obtain the temporary permissions required to carry out cluster operations, such as managing back-end storage, ingress, and registry. These roles are required by the cluster that you create. These required Operator roles are: 

1. `<cluster_name>-<hash>-openshift-cluster-csi-drivers-ebs-cloud-credentials`
1. `<cluster_name>-<hash>-openshift-cloud-network-config-controller-credentials`
1. `<cluster_name>-<hash>-openshift-machine-api-aws-cloud-credentials`
1. `<cluster_name>-<hash>-openshift-cloud-credential-operator-cloud-credentials`
1. `<cluster_name>-<hash>-openshift-image-registry-installer-cloud-credentials`
1. `<cluster_name>-<hash>-openshift-ingress-operator-cloud-credentials`

For more information on creating these roles, see xref:../rosa_architecture/rosa-sts-about-iam-resources.adoc#rosa-sts-operator-roles_rosa-sts-about-iam-resources[Cluster-specific Operator IAM role reference].
