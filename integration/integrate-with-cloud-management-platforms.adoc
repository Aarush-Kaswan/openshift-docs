You can integrate {rh-rhacs-first} with different cloud management platforms to discover potential clusters to secure. The cluster discovery aims to gain a detailed overview of the cluster assets already or not yet secured by {product-title-short}.

The clusters discovered from a cloud management platform are accessible from the *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters* -> *Discovered clusters* page.

{product-title-short} matches the discovered clusters against already secured clusters. Based on the result of the matching, a discovered cluster has one of the following statuses:

* *Secured*: The cluster is secured by {product-title-short}.
* *Unsecured*: The cluster is not secured by {product-title-short}.
* *Undetermined*: The metadata collected from secured clusters is not enough for a unique match. The cluster is either secured or unsecured.

For successful cluster matching, ensure that the following conditions are met:

* Sensors running on secured clusters have been updated to the latest version.
* link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html#allow-access-to-tags-in-IMDS[Access to instance tags via the metadata service] has been granted for secured clusters running on AWS. Sensors require access to the AWS EC2 instance tags to determine the cluster status.

You can integrate {product-title-short} with the following cloud management platforms:
