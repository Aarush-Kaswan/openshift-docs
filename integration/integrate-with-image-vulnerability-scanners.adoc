{product-title} (RHACS) integrates with various vulnerability scanners to enable you to import your container images and watch them for vulnerabilities.
You can set up {product-title} to obtain image vulnerability data from many open source and commercial container image vulnerability scanners, including:

* link:https://github.com/quay/clair[Clair]
* link:https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/container-analysis[Google Container Analysis]
* link:https://quay.io[Red Hat Quay]

If you use one of these products in your DevOps workflow, you can use the {product-title-short} portal to configure an integration with your vulnerability scanner. After the integration, the {product-title-short} portal shows the image vulnerabilities and you can triage them easily.
