== Log forwarding

Administrators can create `ClusterLogForwarder` resources that specify which logs are collected, how they are transformed, and where they are forwarded to.

`ClusterLogForwarder` resources can be used up to forward container, infrastructure, and audit logs to specific endpoints within or outside of a cluster. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is supported so that log forwarders can be configured to send logs securely.

Administrators can also authorize RBAC permissions that define which service accounts and users can access and forward which types of logs.
