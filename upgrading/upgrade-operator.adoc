Upgrades through the {rh-rhacs-first} Operator are performed automatically or manually, depending on the *Update approval* option you chose at installation.

If you installed {product-title-short} using the Operator and selected *Automatic* in the *Update approval* field, {product-title-short} is automatically updated when a new software version is released. If you selected *Manual*, you must approve subsequent Operator updates by using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/operators/administrator-tasks#olm-approving-pending-upgrade_olm-upgrading-operators[Manually approving a pending Operator update].

To roll back an Operator upgrade, you must perform the steps described in one of the following sections. You can roll back an Operator upgrade by using the CLI or the {ocp} web console.
