You must follow a specific upgrade path for {product-title-short} depending on the release of {product-title-short} that you are running. You must also back up your Central database before updating the Helm chart and peforming the upgrade.

[id="upgrading-from-374_{context}"]
== Upgrade sequence from {product-title-short} release 3.74 and earlier

When upgrading from earlier releases, follow this guidance:

* If the release for Central is earlier than 3.74, you must upgrade to the latest 3.74 patch before upgrading to a 4.x release. See the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_security_for_kubernetes/3.74/html/upgrading/index[upgrade documentation for version 3.74] for information about upgrades from earlier versions to 3.74.
* When upgrading Helm-based installations from release 3.74, you can upgrade to any latest patch of {product-title-short} version 4.0 through 4.4. However, for full functionality, upgrade to release 4.4.

If you have installed {product-title-short} by using Helm charts, to upgrade to the latest version of {product-title-short} perform the following steps:

. Back up the Central database.
. Optionally, optimize Central's database and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC).
. Optionally, generate a `values-private.yaml` configuration file containing root certificates for the central-services Helm chart.
. Update the Helm chart.
. Run the `helm upgrade` command.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To ensure optimal functionality, use the same version for your secured-cluster-services Helm chart and central-services Helm chart.
