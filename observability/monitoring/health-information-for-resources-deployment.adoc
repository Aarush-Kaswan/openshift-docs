toc::[]

The {gitops-title} *Environments* page in the *Developer* perspective of the {OCP} web console shows a list of the successful deployments of the application environments, along with links to the revision for each deployment.

The *Application environments* page in the *Developer* perspective of the {OCP} web console displays the health status of the application resources, such as routes, synchronization status, deployment configuration, and deployment history.

The environments pages in the *Developer* perspective of the {OCP} web console are decoupled from the {gitops-title} Application Manager command-line interface (CLI), `kam`. You do not have to use `kam` to generate Application Environment manifests for the environments to show up in the *Developer* perspective of the {OCP} web console. You can use your own manifests, but the environments must still be represented by namespaces. In addition, specific labels and annotations are still needed.
