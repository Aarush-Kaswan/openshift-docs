= Monitoring the {gitops-shortname} Operator performance
:context: monitoring-the-gitops-operator-performance

toc::[]

The {gitops-title} Operator emits metrics about its performance. With the OpenShift monitoring stack that picks up these metrics, you can monitor and analyze the Operatorâ€™s performance. The Operator exposes the following metrics, which you can view by using the {OCP} web console:

.{gitops-shortname} Operator performance metrics
|===
|*Metric name* |*Type* |*Description*

|`active_argocd_instances_total` |Gauge |The total number of active Argo CD instances currently managed by the Operator across the cluster at a given time.

|`active_argocd_instances_by_phase` |Gauge |The number of active Argo CD instances in a given phase, such as pending, or available.

|`active_argocd_instance_reconciliation_count` |Counter |The total number of reconciliations that have occurred for an instance in a given namespace at any given time.

|`controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds_per_instance_bucket` |Counter |The number of reconciliation cycles completed under given time durations for an instance. For example, `controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds_per_instance_bucket{le="0.5"}` shows the number of reconciliations that took under 0.5 seconds to complete for a given instance.

|`controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds_per_instance_count` |Counter |The total number of reconciliation cycles observed for a given instance.

|`controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds_per_instance_sum`|Counter |The total amount of time taken for the observed reconciliations for a given instance.
