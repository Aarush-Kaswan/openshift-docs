After {product-title} is installed, core platform monitoring components immediately begin collecting metrics, which you can query and view.
The default in-cluster monitoring stack includes the core platform Prometheus instance that collects metrics from your cluster and the core Alertmanager instance that routes alerts, among other components.
Depending on who will use the monitoring stack and for what purposes, as a cluster administrator, you can further configure these monitoring components to suit the needs of different users in various scenarios.

In addition to core platform monitoring, you can also optionally xref:../monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[enable monitoring for user-defined projects] for user workload monitoring.
Users can then monitor their own services and workloads without the need for an additional monitoring solution.

== Configuring core platform monitoring: Postinstallation steps

After {product-title} is installed, cluster administrators typically configure core platform monitoring to suit their needs.
These activities include setting up storage and configuring options for Prometheus, Alertmanager, and other monitoring components.

[NOTE]
====
By default, in a newly installed {product-title} system, users can query and view collected metrics.
You need only configure an alert receiver if you want users to receive alert notifications.
Any other configuration options listed here are optional.

* For shorter term data retention, xref:../../observability/monitoring/configuring-the-monitoring-stack.adoc#configuring-persistent-storage_configuring-the-monitoring-stack[configure persistent storage] for Prometheus and Alertmanager to store metrics and alert data.
Specify the metrics data retention parameters for Prometheus and Thanos Ruler.

[NOTE]
====
By default, in a newly installed {product-title} system, the monitoring `ClusterOperator` resource reports a `PrometheusDataPersistenceNotConfigured` status message to remind you that storage is not configured.

With the monitoring stack configured to suit your needs, Prometheus collects metrics from the specified services and stores these metrics according to your settings.
You can go to the *Observe* pages in the {product-title} web console to view and query collected metrics, manage alerts, identify performance bottlenecks, and scale resources as needed:

* xref:../../observability/monitoring/reviewing-monitoring-dashboards.adoc#reviewing-monitoring-dashboards[View dashboards] to visualize collected metrics, troubleshoot alerts, and monitor other information about your cluster.
* xref:../../observability/monitoring/managing-metrics.adoc#about-querying-metrics_managing-metrics[Query collected metrics] by creating PromQL queries or using predefined queries.
