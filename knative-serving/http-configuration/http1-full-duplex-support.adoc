= Full duplex support for HTTP/1
:context: http1-full-duplex-support

You can enable the HTTP/1 full duplex support for a service by configuring the `features.knative.dev/http-full-duplex` annotation.

[NOTE]
====
Verify your HTTP clients before enabling, as earlier version clients might not provide support for HTTP/1 full duplex.
====

The following example shows how you can use this annotation in a Knative `Service` YAML object at the revision spec level:
