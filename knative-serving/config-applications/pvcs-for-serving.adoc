= Persistent Volume Claims for Serving
:context: pvcs-for-serving

Some serverless applications require permanent data storage. By configuring different volume types, you can provide data storage for Knative services. Serving supports mounting of the volume types such as `secret`, `configMap`, `projected`, and `emptyDir`. 

You can configure persistent volume claims (PVCs) for your Knative services. The Persistent volume types are implemented as plugins. To determine if there are any persistent volume types available, you can check the available or installed storage classes in your cluster. Persistent volumes are supported, but require a feature flag to be enabled. 

[WARNING]
====
The mounting of large volumes can lead to a considerable delay in the start time of the application.
