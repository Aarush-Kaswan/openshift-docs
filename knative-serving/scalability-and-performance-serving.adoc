toc::[]

{ServerlessProductName} consists of several different components that have different resource requirements and scaling behaviors. These components are horizontally and vertically scalable, but their resource requirements and configuration highly depend on the actual use-case.

Control-plane components:: These components are responsible for observing and reacting to custom resources and continuously reconfiguring the system, for example, the controller pods.

Data-plane components:: These components are directly involved in requests and response handling, for example, the Knative Servings activator component.

The following metrics and findings were recorded using the following test setup:

* A cluster running {ocp-product-title} 4.13

* The cluster running 4 compute nodes in AWS with a machine type of m6.xlarge

* {ServerlessProductName} 1.30
