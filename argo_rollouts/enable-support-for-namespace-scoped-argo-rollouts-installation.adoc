toc::[]
{gitops-title} enables support for two modes of Argo Rollouts installations:

* *Cluster-scoped installation* (default): The Argo Rollouts custom resources (CRs) defined in any namespace are reconciled by the Argo Rollouts instance. As a result, you can use Argo Rollouts CR across any namespace on the cluster.
* *Namespace-scoped installation*: The Argo Rollouts instance is installed in a specific namespace and only handles an Argo Rollouts CR within the same namespace. This installation mode includes the following benefits:
** This mode does not require cluster-wide `ClusterRole` or `ClusterRoleBinding` permissions. You can install and use Argo Rollouts within a single namespace without requiring cluster permissions.
** This mode provides security benefits by limiting the cluster scope of a single Argo Rollouts instance to a specific namespace.

[NOTE]
====
To prevent unintended privilege escalation, {gitops-title} allows only one mode of Argo Rollout installation at a time.

To switch between cluster-scoped and namespace-scoped Argo Rollouts installations, complete the following steps.
