Argo Rollouts supports link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/deployments/deployment-strategies.html#deployments-canary-deployments_deployment-strategies[canary] and link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/deployments/route-based-deployment-strategies.html#deployments-blue-green_route-based-deployment-strategies[blue-green] deployment strategies. This guide provides instructions with examples using a canary deployment strategy to help you deploy, update, promote and manually abort rollouts.

With a canary-based deployment strategy, you split traffic between two application versions:

* *Canary version*: A new version of an application where you gradually route the traffic.
* *Stable version*: The current version of an application. After the canary version is stable and has all the user traffic directed to it, it becomes the new stable version. The previous stable version is discarded.
