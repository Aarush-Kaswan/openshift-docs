== Installing and configuring the OpenShift Update Service
xref:../updating/installing-update-service.adoc#installing-update-service[Installing and configuring the OpenShift Update Service]: For clusters with internet accessibility, Red Hat provides over-the-air updates through an {product-title} update service as a hosted service located behind public APIs. If you are on a restricted network where disconnected clusters cannot access the public APIs, you can install the OpenShift Update Service locally. For more information, see the following procedures:

== Understanding upgrade channels and releases
xref:../updating/understanding-upgrade-channels-release.adoc#understanding-upgrade-channels-releases[Understanding upgrade channels and releases]: Upgrade channels allow you to choose an upgrade strategy. Upgrade channels are specific to a minor version of {product-title}. The `openshift-install` binary file for a specific version of {product-title} always installs that minor version. In addition to the minor version, you can select from the `candidate`, `fast`, `stable` and `eus` channel tiers to enable an update strategy that suits the needs of your environment. For more information, see the following:

== Updating a restricted network cluster
xref:../updating/updating-restricted-network-cluster.adoc#updating-restricted-network-cluster[Updating a restricted network cluster]: A restricted network environment is one in which your cluster nodes cannot access the internet. You can update a restricted network cluster by using the OpenShift CLI (oc). In a restricted network environment, you can configure your {product-title} clusters to receive updates using a local OpenShift Update Service instance. If your mirror host cannot access both the internet and the cluster, you can mirror the images to a file system that is disconnected from that environment and then bring that host or removable media across that gap. If the local container registry and the cluster are connected to the host of the mirror registry, you can directly push the release images to the local registry.
