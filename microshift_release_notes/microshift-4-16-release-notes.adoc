{product-title} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

//TODO verify K8s version and another other relevant notes

For lifecycle information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/product-life-cycles?product=Red%20Hat%20build%20of%20Microshift,Red%20Hat%20Device%20Edge[{product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

//L3 major categories with features in each as L4s
[id="microshift-4-16-rhel"]
=== {op-system-base-full}
//* {microshift-short} now runs on {op-system-base-full} 9.4

// Some details of the next note are adapted from https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/08/31/cgroupv2-ga-1-25/
* {microshift-short} uses crun and Control Group v2 (cgroup v2). If workloads rely on the cgroup file system layout, they might need to be updated to be compatible with cgroup v2.

** If you run third-party monitoring and security agents that depend on the cgroup file system, update the agents to versions that support cgroup v2.
** If you run cAdvisor as a standalone DaemonSet for monitoring pods and containers, update it to v0.43.0 or later.
** If you deploy Java applications with JDK, ensure you are using JDK 11.0.16 and later or JDK 15 and later, which fully support cgroup v2.

[id="microshift-4-16-updating"]
=== Updating
Updating two minor versions in a single step is now supported. Updates for both single-version minor releases and patch releases are also still supported.

[id="microshift-4-16-updates-supported"]
==== Update two minor versions in a single step
See the following list for details:

* You can update from one long-life-cycle version of {microshift-short} directly to another, without applying the intermediate version. For example, you can update directly to 4.16 from 4.14. Updating 4.14 to 4.15 before updating to 4.16 is no longer required.
* Now, you can focus on developing applications for your devices in remote locations and with limited bandwidth, rather than planning for updates.
* {microshift-short} offers in-place updates on {op-system-ostree} systems with automatic system rollback capabilities and automatic back up and restore functions.
* Updates of the RPMs on a non-OSTree system such as {op-system} are also supported.
* See xref:../microshift_updating/microshift-update-options.adoc#microshift-update-options[Update options with {product-title} and {op-system-bundle}] for details.

==== GitOps with Argo CD now available
With this release, you can use the GitOps with Argo CD agent derived from GitOps 1.12 with {microshift-short}. Using GitOps means you can update a single Git repository and automate the deployment of new applications or updates to existing ones. You can also use your Git repository as an audit trail of changes so that you can create processes such as review and approval for merging pull requests that implement configuration changes.
