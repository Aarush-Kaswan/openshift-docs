{product-title} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

//TODO verify K8s version and another other relevant notes

You can deploy {microshift-short} clusters to on-premise, cloud, disconnected, and offline environments.

//TODO: Update OP system versions
{microshift-short} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} or {op-system-ostree-first} 9.4.

For lifecycle information, see the link:https://access.redhat.com/product-life-cycles?product=Red%20Hat%20build%20of%20Microshift,Red%20Hat%20Device%20Edge[{product-title} Life Cycle Policy].

=== {op-system-base-full}
* {microshift-short} {product-version} runs on {op-system-base-full} 9.4.

[id="microshift-4-17-updating_{context}"]
=== Updating
Updating two minor versions in a single step is supported in 4.17. Updates for both single-version minor releases and patch releases are still supported.

[id="microshift-4-17-IPv6_{context}"]
==== IPv6 single and dual-stack IPv6 networking now available
With this release, you can run {microshift-short} and your workloads with either IPv6 only or IPv4 and IPv6 dual stack networking protocols. Ingress and egress traffic can be on either IPv4 or IPv6 traffic, mixed or parallel. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-using-config-tools.adoc#microshift-using-config-tools[Configuring IPv6 networking].

[id="microshift-4-17-LVMS-resource-footprint-reduction_{context}"]
==== Resource footprint reduction for LVM storage driver now available
With this release, the resource footprint of the LVM storage driver is significantly reduced, particularly in terms of memory consumption.

[id="microshift-4-17-running-apps_{context}"]
=== Running applications

[id="microshift-4-17-low-latency_{context}"]
====  Low-latency performance for applications now available
You can now run a {microshift-short} cluster with low-latency response rates. Using a low-latency {microshift-short} configuration with operating system tuning results in reduced application response times and can include deterministic performance. Using workload partitioning is also recommended.
//TODO crossref

[id="microshift-4-17-workload-partitioning_{context}"]
==== Support for workload partitioning
With this release, workload partitioning is supported in {microshift-short}.

[id="microshift-4-17-tech-preview_{context}"]
== Technology preview features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These experimental features are not intended for production use. Note the following scope of support on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal for these features:

[id="microshift-4-17-rhel-image-mode_{context}"]
=== {op-system-base-full} image mode Technology Preview feature
* You can now install {microshift-short} using a `bootc` container image. Image mode for {op-system} is a technology preview deployment method that uses a container-native approach to build, deploy and manage the operating system as a bootc container image.

//[id="microshift-4-17-pods-writing-files-excess-memory-limits-crash_{context}"]
//=== Pods crash when writing files that exceed memory limits
//Because of an issue with {op-system-base}, when a pod tries to write files that are larger than configured memory limits to a persistent volume claim, the pod might crash with an out-of-memory error. The pod status shows `OOMKilled` when this occurs. Use the following workarounds to avoid this issue: link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7076169[Pods writing files larger than memory limit to PVCs tend to OOM frequently running on MicroShift](Red Hat Knowledgebase).
