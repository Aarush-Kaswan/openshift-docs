{product-title} provides developers and IT organizations with small-form-factor and edge computing delivered as an application that customers can deploy on top of their managed {op-system-base-full} devices at the edge. Built on {OCP} and Kubernetes, {microshift-short} provides an efficient way to operate single-node clusters in low-resource edge environments.

{microshift-short} is designed to make control plane restarts economical and be lifecycle-managed as a single unit by the operating system. Updates, roll-backs, and configuration changes consist of simply staging another version in parallel and then - without relying on a network - flipping to and from that version and restarting.

//TODO verify K8s version and another other relevant notes
[id="microshift-4-17-about-this-release_{context}"]
== About this release
Version 4.17 of {product-title} includes new features and enhancements. Update to the latest version of {microshift-short} to receive all of the latest features, bug fixes, and security updates. {microshift-short} is derived from {OCP} {OCP-version} and uses the CRI-O container runtime. New features, changes, and known issues that pertain to {microshift-short} are included in this topic.

You can deploy {microshift-short} clusters to on-premise, cloud, disconnected, and offline environments.

//TODO: Update OP system versions
{microshift-short} {product-version} is supported on {op-system-base-full} 9.4.

[id="microshift-4-17-networking_{context}"]
=== Networking

[id="microshift-4-17-IPv6_{context}"]
==== IPv6 single and dual-stack IPv6 networking now available
With this release, you can run {microshift-short} and your workloads with either IPv6 only or IPv4 and IPv6 dual-stack networking protocols. Ingress and egress traffic can be on either IPv4 or IPv6 traffic, mixed or parallel. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift-nw-ipv6-config.adoc#microshift-nw-ipv6-config[Configuring IPv6 networking].

[id="microshift-4-17-storage_{context}"]
=== Storage

[id="microshift-4-17-LVMS-resource-footprint-reduction_{context}"]
==== Resource footprint reduction for LVM storage driver now available
With this release, the resource footprint of the LVM storage driver is significantly reduced, particularly in terms of memory consumption.

[id="microshift-4-17-LVMS-volume-snapshot-deployment-optional_{context}"]
==== Disabling and uninstalling LVM Storage CSI provider and CSI snapshot deployments now available
With this release, {microshift-short} can now be configured to disable and uninstall the container storage interface (CSI) provider or the CSI snapshot capabilities which can reduce the use of runtime resources such as RAM, CPU, and storage. See xref:../microshift_storage/microshift-storage-plugin-overview.adoc#microshift-disabling-uninstalling-lvms-csi-snapshot_microshift-storage-plugin-overview[Disabling and uninstalling LVMS CSI provider and CSI snapshot deployments].

[id="microshift-4-17-running-apps_{context}"]
=== Running applications

[id="microshift-4-17-low-latency_{context}"]
====  Low-latency performance for applications now available
You can now run a {microshift-short} cluster with low-latency response rates. Using a low-latency {microshift-short} configuration with operating system tuning results in reduced application response times and can include deterministic performance. Using workload partitioning is also recommended. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift_low_latency/microshift-low-latency.adoc#microshift-low-latency[Configuring low latency] for more information.

[id="microshift-4-17-workload-partitioning_{context}"]
==== Support for workload partitioning
With this release, workload partitioning is supported in {microshift-short}. See xref:../microshift_configuring/microshift_low_latency/microshift-workload-partitioning.adoc#microshift-workload-partitioning[Workload partitioning] for more information.

//[id="microshift-4-17-support_{context}"]
//=== Support

[id="microshift-4-17-doc-enhancements_{context}"]
=== Documentation enhancements
//Doc enhancements include additions for RFEs and other continuous improvement items that are substantial and are not tied to new features or bug fixes already listed here. These can also go under the relevant section as applicable.

[id="microshift-4-17-data-cleanup_{context}"]
==== Data cleanup now documented
With this release, the `microshift-cleanup-data` script is documented. See xref:../microshift_troubleshooting/microshift-cleanup-data.adoc#microshift-cleanup-data[Data cleanup] for more information.

[id="microshift-4-17-tech-preview_{context}"]
== Technology preview features

Some features in this release are currently in Technology Preview. These experimental features are not intended for production use. Note the following scope of support on the Red{nbsp}Hat Customer Portal for these features:

link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview Features Support Scope]

[id="microshift-4-17-rhel-image-mode_{context}"]
=== {op-system-base-full} image mode Technology Preview feature
* You can now install {microshift-short} using a `bootc` container image. Image mode for {op-system} is a technology preview deployment method that uses a container-native approach to build, deploy and manage the operating system as a bootc container image.

See xref:../microshift_install_bootc/microshift-install-rhel-image-mode.adoc#microshift-install-rhel-image-mode[Using image mode for RHEL with {microshift-short}] for more information.

//[id="microshift-4-17-pods-writing-files-excess-memory-limits-crash_{context}"]
//=== Pods crash when writing files that exceed memory limits
//Because of an issue with {op-system-base}, when a pod tries to write files that are larger than configured memory limits to a persistent volume claim, the pod might crash with an out-of-memory error. The pod status shows `OOMKilled` when this occurs. Use the following workarounds to avoid this issue: link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7076169[Pods writing files larger than memory limit to PVCs tend to OOM frequently running on MicroShift](Red Hat Knowledgebase).
